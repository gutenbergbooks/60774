<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE time at which this volume appears would seem
to require a few words of introduction.</p>

<p>A day which closes a great epoch in the history of
modern times, will soon be called to the remembrance
of Protestant Christians. The registers of the Consistory
of Geneva for the year 1564, bear under the name
of Calvin these simple words:</p>

<p><i>Allé à Dieu le Sabmedy 27 de May, entre huit et
neuf heures du soir.</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_1" id="Ref_1" href="#Foot_1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>The author of this volume, having been invited by
the Evangelical Alliance to deliver an address on
<i>The Reformation and the Reformer of Geneva</i>, during
the Œcumenical Conference held at Geneva in September,
1861, observed, in the course of his preparatory
work, this important date, and proposed to the assembly
that on the tercentenary of the Reformer's death,
Geneva and the Reformed Churches in general, should
return thanks publicly to God that he had raised up
John Calvin in the sixteenth century, to labour at the
reformation of the Church, by re-establishing Holy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">{viii}</a></span>
Scripture as the supreme authority, and grace as the
only means of salvation. The members of the Conference,
about two thousand in number, adopted the
resolution by acclamation.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_2" id="Ref_2" href="#Foot_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>As Christian Protestants were preparing to celebrate
the anniversary, the author desired to contribute something
according to his ability towards reviving the
memory of the great doctor. Almost at the very time
when the idea of this Protestant festival occurred to his
mind, he proposed to describe in a special work, <i>The
Reformation of Europe in the time of Calvin</i>. Having
published the first two volumes more than a year ago,
he looked forward to issuing another before the 27th
May, and he now presents it to the public. May it
occupy its humble place among the memorials destined
to commemorate the Lord's work.</p>

<p>The persecuting jesuitry of the seventeenth century,
and the superficial incredulity of the eighteenth, have
calumniated the great Reformer of the West. Times
have changed, and the nineteenth century is beginning
to do him justice. His works, even those still in
manuscript, are sought after and published; his life
and character, his theology and influence, are the
object of numerous studies which in general bear the
stamp of fairness; and even distinguished painters have
found the subject of their finest pictures in his life.</p>

<p>We entertain no blind admiration for him. We know
that he has sometimes used bitter language. We acknowledge
that, sharing in the faults of his century,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">{ix}</a></span>
or rather of ten centuries, he believed that whatever
infringed on the respect due to God ought to be
punished by the civil power, quite as much as anything
that might be injurious to the honour or the life
of man. We deplore this error. But how can any
one study with discernment the Reformer's letters and
other writings, and not recognise in him one of the
noblest intelligences, one of the most elevated minds,
one of the most affectionate hearts, and in short, one
of those true Christian souls who unreservedly devote
themselves to duty? An eminent scholar, whom Scotland
still laments—Dr. Cunningham, the successor of
Chalmers—said, in a work published a short time
before his death, 'Calvin is the man who, next to
St. Paul, has done most good to mankind.'</p>

<p>No doubt he will always have his enemies. A journal
of high character and great circulation in Germany,
speaking of a libel (<i>Schmæhschrift</i> is the word used),
published some time ago against Calvin, asks 'From
what camp does it proceed—from jesuitical Romanism
or atheistical libertinism?' It is, indeed, from these
quarters that the enemies of the Reformer principally
come; but we acknowledge that a man may be opposed
to Calvin, and yet not belong to either of these schools.</p>

<p>Let us not disquiet ourselves, however, about such
attacks; Calvin's Master has said, <i>If they do these
things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_3" id="Ref_3" href="#Foot_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>The author of the present volume thinks that the
best way of doing justice to his memory, is to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">{x}</a></span>
him known. The reader will meet in this work with
many sayings and doings of this great man, which are
not to be found in other histories. If a writer had
the good fortune to lay before the German public
some unknown trait of Luther's life, all Germany
would be taken up with it. Shall we be more indifferent
to the life of our great Reformer? Certainly
there are more striking actions in the life of Luther,
who so easily gains possession of our hearts; but we
may ask whether there are not features in the life of
Calvin, which are less frequent in that of the Wittemberg
doctor; the manner, for instance, in which the
young doctor of Noyon, wherever he happens to be
(at Angoulême, Poitiers, &amp;c.), is at once surrounded
by distinguished men, whom he wins over to the
truth?</p>

<p>The author desires, however, to remind some of his
readers, that this book is not the history of Calvin.
The title expresses that clearly enough: <i>History of the
Reformation</i> <span class="smc">in Europe</span> <i>in the time of Calvin</i>. It is
the second series of a work of which the <i>History of
the Reformation of the Sixteenth Century</i>, was the first.
The reformation of the Western nations, of which
Calvin was the soul, having a special character, we
thought it our duty to devote a special work to it;
but we shall not confine ourselves to relating the facts
of the Reformation in which Calvin took a direct part.
One portion of the fourth volume will describe the
Reformation in England, from the fall of Wolsey.
We purpose also to continue retracing the leading
features of the Reformation in Germany, as we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">{xi}</a></span>
already done in the first two volumes of this work, in
which the alliance of Smalkalde, the peace of Nuremberg,
the emancipation of Wurtemberg, and other
analogous events have found their place.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_4" id="Ref_4" href="#Foot_4">[4]</a></span>
It is the
Reformation as a whole which the author desires to
delineate.</p>

<p>After speaking of France and Calvin, the author
relates, in the present volume, facts which concern
Latin Switzerland (Suisse Romande), the Waldensian
villages of Piedmont, and finally Geneva.</p>

<p>He does not think it proper to pass by unnoticed
certain reproaches which the first two volumes have
brought upon him. 'It is a strange idea,' some have
said, 'to devote so much space to Geneva. Is it not
doing too much honour to a little city of a few thousand
souls? History requires great people and mighty
personages. We meet with these at least around
Luther; but in Geneva, we find none but humble
syndics and petty citizens.'</p>

<p>True, it is so. In this part of our history we have
to deal with a little city and a little people; and even
in this democratic age, there are persons who will put
up with nothing but electors and kings. May we be
permitted to reply that what is small, as regards outward
appearances, is sometimes important as regards
moral influence. This is a truth often reverted to in
Holy Scripture: <i>The ships, though they be so great, yet
are they turned about with a very small helm</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_5" id="Ref_5" href="#Foot_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>This portion of our narrative contains two parts:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">{xii}</a></span>
one is devoted to a man—Calvin; the other to a city—Geneva.
These two existences seem in the eyes of
many persons to evolve separately, as if they were
never to meet. But there is a close relation between
them: from the very beginning they are destined
to unite. Each is energetic, though without parade,
and their alliance will in some future day double their
strength. When Calvin and Geneva are one, many
men and nations will feel their powerful and salutary
influence. It is a marriage that will produce a numerous
and active posterity. Whatever the friends of
worldly greatness may say, this union, when it took
place, was an event of more importance to the human
race, than that which led a panegyrist of Louis XIV.
to exclaim, in reference to a celebrated event—</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The idea expressed above will not be generally accepted.
The smallness of the scene which it unfolds
will prevent the second work from interesting so
much as the first. And yet there have been critics
who have felt the importance of the history of Geneva.
May we be permitted to give a few examples?</p>

<p>The <i>London Review</i> says: 'For the narrowness of
the field—a small city—the variety of characters presented
may well astonish us. The dew-drop is big
enough to hold an image of the heavens and earth;
and a city closely studied mirrors an empire. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">{xiii}</a></span>
story is crowded with incidents and surprises, with
heroic deeds and endurance, and also with foul deeds
and shames.' Some reviewers have gone so far as
to place the facts of the second work above those of
the first. The <i>New York Observer</i> says: 'The story
of the times in which the Swiss Reformation was
wrought is surrounded with a sublimity, romantic
grandeur, and interest that attach to no part of the
great German movement under Luther.'</p>

<p>We omit the remarks of other journals, particularly
of the <i>Saturday Review</i>, which rejoices to see 'the
Genevese champions of liberty brought to light.' We
must, however, quote one more, the <i>Patriot</i>, which
says: 'Geneva is one of the smallest and one of the
most heroic cities of Europe. Had it been predicted,
its history would have been incredible. Geneva defied
not only the Duke of Savoy and the Pope, but the
Emperor Charles V., and dared also his scarcely less
powerful rival Francis I.; and in spite of them all it
won, first, its political and then its religious liberties,
and not for itself only but for Northern Europe.
More than once it was the Thermopylæ of Protestantism
and freedom, bravely held by an heroic little
band scarcely more in comparison with those who
sought to destroy them than the three hundred men
of Leonidas in comparison with the Persians.'</p>

<p>But if the opinions of some were favourable to the
little city, the criticisms of others were not so; and
as the author will again speak of Geneva in this
volume, and (God willing) in others, he desires to
say a word of explanation with reference to these
objections.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">{xiv}</a></div>

<p>If the work is found uninteresting, the fault must
be ascribed to the historian, not to the history. The
talent of one of the great masters of history would
have prevented all reproach; but the workman
damaged the work. Can the present generation have
become so fastidious as to cease to feel interest in what
is great and beautiful of itself, and to need all the
refinements of style in order to revive its morbid
tastes?</p>

<p>Geneva is a republic, and this, perhaps, may also
have told against our narrative. Some persons have
fancied that when the author spoke of liberty, he
meant liberty in the republican form alone, and
that may have displeased them. But that is a
mistake; the author has always had in view that
constitutional liberty which includes all modern
liberties, and not any particular form of it. He even
believes that the monarchical form is the most
favourable to the liberties of a great nation. It has
been his lot to see side by side, a republic without
liberty and a monarchy in which all were free.</p>

<p>The coldness, however, of some readers for the
annals of a little people, proceeds in the main from
another cause. There are in reality two histories:
one which is external and makes much noise, but
whose consequences are not lasting; the other, which
is internal, has but a mean appearance, like the seed
when it germinates; and which nevertheless bears
most precious fruit. Now what pleases the general
public is a narrative in which great armies manœuvre;
while, on the other hand, what touches the author
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">{xv}</a></span>
is the movement of the soul, of strong characters,
enthusiastic outbursts, the low estate of humble and
tranquil hearts, holy affections, life-giving principles,
the faith which gains victories, and the Divine life
which regenerates nations—in a word, the moral
world. The material world, physical and appreciable
forces, parks of artillery and glittering squadrons,
possess but a secondary interest in his eyes. Numerous
cannons (it is true) give more smoke; but to
those external powers, which destroy life, he prefers
the internal powers which elevate the soul, warm it
for truth, for liberty, and for God, and cause it to be
born again to life everlasting. If these internal forces
are developed in the midst of a little people, they
possess all the more attraction for him.</p>

<p>If humble heroes are not popular, shall I therefore
leave their noble actions in obscurity? Shall I limit
myself henceforward to bringing princes and kings
on the stage, with statesmen, cardinals, armies,
treaties, and empires? No: I cannot do so. I shall
have to speak, indeed, of Francis I. and Charles V.,
of Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII., and other great
personages; but I shall still remain faithful to little
people and little things. It is indeed a petty city
whose struggles I am relating; but it is the city that
for two centuries made head against Rome, until she
had resigned the task entrusted to her into the hands
of more powerful nations—England, Germany, and
America. Let the liberals despise her who at this
very time most enjoy the fruits of her severe struggles....
Be it so.... As for me, I have not the courage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">{xvi}</a></span>
to follow them. I call to mind the refugees she has
entertained ... the asylum they found there, and
which their children still enjoy ... and I desire to
pay my debt. Oh! if she would only understand that
she cannot exist with honour in the future, unless,
while loving liberty, she loves the Gospel more than
everything else.</p>

<p>Let me say a few words more on the principles
which have guided me in composing this history.
What it is necessary for us to study above all things
is, in my opinion, the beginnings. The formation of
beings, the origin of the successive phases of humanity,
possess in my eyes an importance and interest far
surpassing the exhibition of what these things have
afterwards become. The creative epoch of Christianity,
in which we contemplate Christ and His
apostles, is to me far more admirable than those which
succeeded it. Similarly the Reformation, which is
the creation of the evangelical world in modern times,
has greater attractions for me than the Protestantism
which comes after. I take a pleasure in watching life
in its commencement. When the work is done, its
<i>summa momenta</i> are over. In the first lines of the
first volume of my first work, I said that I should
follow this rule. I shall not be reproached for
remaining faithful to it.</p>

<p>An objection has been raised that this history is too
full of details. I might reply that it is not good to
leave facts in vagueness; that they must be analysed
and described. The surrounding circumstances can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">{xvii}</a></span>
alone give an accurate knowledge of events, and impress
on them the stamp of reality. The author may
here quote an authority which no one will dispute.
He remembers, that being in Paris at M. Guizot's, just
as the first volume of the <i>History of the Reformation</i>
appeared—about thirty years ago—that illustrious
writer said to him: 'Give us <span class="smc">details</span>, the rest we
know.' We do not think that many of our readers
will fancy they know more than he does.</p>

<p>Another conviction also exercises some influence
on the character of my narrative. It seems to me
that the study of the unknown has a peculiar charm.
Geneva and its struggles for liberty and the Gospel,
are a <i>terra incognita</i>, except to its citizens and a few
men of letters. When historians describe ancient or
modern times—for example, the Revolution of the
Netherlands, of England, or of France,—they can only
say a little better what others have already said before
them. Perhaps there is some advantage in exploring
a virgin soil—in adding new facts to that treasury
which ought to be the wisdom of nations. The author
is not, however, blind to the truth there may have
been in some of the criticisms upon his work—and
while following the principles he has laid down, he
will endeavour to profit by them.</p>

<p>He had hoped to publish the third and fourth
volumes together this year. Having been forced to
pass the winter of 1862-63 at Nice, with injunctions
to abstain from work, he publishes one only now; but
the next, God willing, will not be long delayed.</p>

<p>On returning from Nice, the author passed through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">{xviii}</a></span>
Piedmont, partly to be present at a synod in the
Waldensian valleys, which reminded him of the one described
in this volume; and partly to make researches
among the General Archives of the kingdom at
Turin. The valuable collections there contained were
liberally thrown open to him, and he was able to
select and transcribe some precious documents hitherto
unknown, of which, as will be seen, he made immediate
use. While thanking the various persons who
have been useful to him in his researches, the author
desires also to express his acknowledgments to the
translator of this work, Dr. H. White, who has spared
no pains in conveying to the English reader a faithful
and animated copy of the original. The translation
has been carefully revised by the author with great
care, line by line and word by word, and some changes,
not in the French edition, have been introduced.</p>

<p>Will this work obtain a success similar to that
which attended the former one? That treated of the
Reformation in Germany, with Luther as its hero;
this treats especially of the Reform in Western Europe,
with Calvin as its head. The scene of the latter being
nearer home, ought to have more interest for British
readers; or shall a new-born passion for Germany and
the Germans make them look with indifference on all
that does not directly concern the country of Luther?...
France, Holland, England, Scotland, Switzerland
should possess some attraction for them. The history,
hitherto almost unknown, of the Reformation of Geneva
is not only attractive in itself, it is also of
importance with regard to England. Geneva is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">{xix}</a></span>
representative of a Christian system, of a great doctrine,—that
of the supreme authority of Holy Scripture,
and of the pure Gospel. The final triumph of
this doctrine is of the greatest consequence for the
English churches. A well-known British theologian
of our day has said: 'Two systems of doctrine are
now, and probably for the last time, in conflict—the
Catholic and the <i>Genevan</i>.'<span

<p class="drop-cap">RELIGION needs liberty, and the convictions inspired
by her ought to be exempt from the control
of the Louvre and of the Vatican. Man's conscience
belongs to God alone, and every human power that
encroaches on this kingdom and presumes to command
within it is guilty of rebellion against its lawful
sovereign. Religious persecution deserves to be
reprobated, not only in the name of philosophy, but
above all in the name of God's right. His sovereign
Majesty is offended when the sword enters into the
sanctuary. A persecuting government is not only
illiberal, it is impious. Let no man thrust himself
between God and the soul! The spot on which they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{2}</a></span>
meet is holy ground. Away, intruder! Leave the
soul with Him to whom it belongs.</p>

<p>These thoughts naturally occur to us as we approach
an epoch when a persecuting fanaticism broke
out in France, when scaffolds were raised in the
streets of Paris, and when acts of terrible cruelty
were enthusiastically applauded by a royal cortége.</p>

<p>These rights of conscience, which we record, are
not new. They date neither from our century, nor
from the sixteenth. The Saviour established them
when he said: '<i>Render unto Cæsar the things which
are Cæsar's, and</i> <span class="smc">unto God the things that are God's</span>.'
Since that hour they have been maintained
by many courageous voices. During three centuries
the martyrs said to the pagan emperors: 'Is it not
an irreligious act to forbid my worshipping the God
whom I like, and to force me to worship the god
whom I dislike?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_8" id="Ref_8" href="#Foot_8">[8]</a></span>
In the fourth century Athanasius
and Hilary told the Arian princes: 'Satan uses violence,
he dashes in the doors with an axe ... but
persuasion is the only weapon truth employs.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_9" id="Ref_9" href="#Foot_9">[9]</a></span>
In later years, when the barbarians desired to bend the
Church under the weight of brute force, the hitherto
servile clergy declared as loudly as they could that
religious doctrine did not fall under the dominion of
the temporal sword.</p>

<p class="side">=ROME, A PERSECUTING POWER.=</p>

<p>When, therefore, in the bloody days of the Reformation,
the power of Rome, uniting in some countries
with the power of the princes, wished to constrain
men's souls and force them to submit to its laws, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">{3}</a></span>
evangelical christians, by claiming liberty in their
turn, only asserted the great principle of Jesus Christ
formerly adopted by the Church herself. But, strange
to say! this principle which she had found so admirable,
when she had to employ it in self-defence, became
impious when it was appealed to in order to
escape from her persecutions. Such inconsistencies
frequently occur in the history of fallen humanity.
We must call them to remembrance though it be with
sorrow. There have always existed many generous
persons in the bosom of catholicity who have protested
with horror against the frightful punishments by
which it was attempted to make our forefathers renounce
their faith; and there are still more now, for
the laws of religious liberty are gradually becoming
established among nations. But we must never forget
that two centuries of cruel persecution was the
welcome the world gave to the Reformation. When
the day of St. Bartholomew saw the streets of the
capital of the Valois run with blood,—when ruffians
glutted their savage passions on the corpse of that
best and greatest of Frenchmen, Coligny—immense
was the enthusiasm at Rome, and a fierce shout of exultation
rang through the pontifical city.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_10" id="Ref_10" href="#Foot_10">[10]</a></span>
Wishing to perpetuate the glory of the massacre of the huguenots,
the pope ordered a medal to be struck, representing
that massacre and bearing the device: <i>Hugonotorum
strages</i>. The officers of the Roman court still sell
(as we know personally) this medal to all who desire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
to carry away some remembrance of their city. Those
times are remote; milder manners prevail, but it is
the duty of protestantism to remind the world of the
use made by the court of Rome, on emerging from the
middle ages, of that <i>pre-eminence</i> in catholic countries,
which she contends belongs to her always, and
which she is still ready to claim 'with the greatest
vigour.' Resistance to this cruel pre-eminence cost
the Reformation torrents of the purest blood; and
it is this blood which gives us the right to protest
against it.</p>

<p>Before we describe the scenes of horror that defiled
the streets of Paris at this period, we must follow
in his flight that young doctor, who, though illustrious
in after years, was now the victim of persecution.</p>

<p class="gap-above2">The feast of All Saints being the day when the
university celebrated the opening of the academical
year, Calvin (as we have seen), through the channel
of his friend Cop the rector, had displayed before
the Sorbonne and a numerous audience the great
principles of the Gospel. University, monks, priests
had all been excited, scandalised, and exasperated;
parliament had interfered; and Cop and Calvin were
obliged to flee.</p>

<p>That man whose hand was one day boldly to raise
the standard of the Gospel in the world, whose teaching
was to enlighten many nations, and whose eloquence
was to stir all France; that man who was yearly to
send forth from Geneva some thirty or forty missionaries,
and whose letters strengthened all the Churches;
that man, still young, pursued by the lieutenant-criminal
and his sergeants, had been forced to steal out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
of his chamber into the street and disguise himself in
strange garments; and in the beginning of November,
he found himself in the back streets on the left bank of
the Seine looking on every side lest there should be
any one on his track. He had never been more tranquil
than at the moment when struck by this sudden blow.
Francis I. resisted the insolence of the monks; the
Sorbonne had been compelled to disavow their most
fanatical acts; many Lutherans were able to preach
the Gospel freely to those around them; a reforming
movement seemed spreading far and wide through
France ... when suddenly the lightning darted
forth and struck the young reformer. 'I thought I
should be able to devote myself to God's service without
hindrance,' said he in his flight; 'I promised myself
a tranquil career; ... but at that very moment,
what I expected least, namely persecution and exile,
were at the door.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_11" id="Ref_11" href="#Foot_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN'S FLIGHT.=</p>

<p>Calvin did not regret, however, the testimony he
had borne to the truth, and resigned himself to exile.
Far from resembling the unbroken horse (to use
his own expression) who refuses to carry his rider,
he voluntarily bowed his shoulders to the cross.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_12" id="Ref_12" href="#Foot_12">[12]</a></span>
<i>Never tire in the middle of your journey</i>, was his maxim always.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_13" id="Ref_13" href="#Foot_13">[13]</a></span>
Yet as he travelled along those rough byroads
of the Mantois, he often asked himself what this
severe dispensation was to teach him. Was he to
retire from Paris and renounce the idea of making
that city the centre of his christian activity? That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
would, indeed, be a hard trial for him. His people
seemed to be waking, and he must leave them!...
Still he kept on his way. On arriving near Mantes, he
went to the residence of the Sire de Haseville, to whom
he was known, and there remained in hiding several
days. He then resumed his journey, either because
he thought himself too near his enemies, or because
his host was afraid.</p>

<p>Calvin took the road to the south; he crossed the
charming plains and valleys of Touraine, entered the
pasturages and forests of Poitou, and thence turned
his steps towards Saintonge and the Angoumois.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_14" id="Ref_14" href="#Foot_14">[14]</a></span>
This latter province was the end of his journey. On
a hill at whose foot the Charente 'softly flowed,'
stood the cathedral, the old castle and city of Angoulême,
the birth-place of Margaret of Navarre. Calvin
entered the gates of this antique town, and made his
way to one of the principal streets, which afterwards
received in his honour the name it still bears—<i>Rue de
Genève</i>. In that street was a large mansion whose
principal apartment was a long gallery in which more
than four thousand volumes, printed or manuscript,
were collected: it was one of the most valuable private
libraries then existing in France.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_15" id="Ref_15" href="#Foot_15">[15]</a></span>
The fugitive halted
before this house. Learned works were doubtless well
calculated to attract him; but he was animated by
another motive also. This mansion belonged to the
family of Du Tillet, whose members were reckoned
among the most learned in the kingdom. The father
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
and two of his sons were detained in Paris by their
duties in the Chamber of Accounts, at the Louvre
and in parliament; but another son, Louis, canon of
the cathedral, was at Angoulême, and lived alone in
that large house, when he was not at his parish of
Claix. Louis was Calvin's friend,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_16" id="Ref_16" href="#Foot_16">[16]</a></span>
and it was the
remembrance of this gentle, mild, and rather weak
young man, whose disposition was very engaging,
that had induced the fugitive to bend his steps towards
the Angoumois.</p>

<p class="side">=DU TILLET'S HOUSE AND LIBRARY.=</p>

<p>Calvin stopped in front of his friend's house and
knocked at the door, it opened, and he went in: we
cannot say whether he found the canon there or not,
but at all events the latter was filled with joy when
he heard of the arrival of the young doctor, whose
'great gifts and grace' he admired so much, and
whose intimacy had been so sweet to him. Calvin
told him how he had been obliged to flee from the
attacks of the parliament, and of the danger to which
those who gave him refuge were exposed. But Du
Tillet thought himself the happiest of men, if he could
but shelter his friend from the search of his enemies.
Once more he was about to enjoy those spiritual
and edifying conversations which he had so often
regretted and could never forget.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_17" id="Ref_17" href="#Foot_17">[17]</a></span>
Even the persecution
of which Calvin was a victim made him all
the dearer to his friend; and Louis introduced him
into the vast gallery, installed him in the midst of
the most eminent minds of all ages, whose celebrated
works loaded the numerous shelves, and established
him, as in a safe retreat, in that beautiful library
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
which seemed prepared for the lofty intelligence and
profound studies of the theologian.</p>

<p>Calvin, who needed retirement and repose, felt
happy. 'I am never less alone than when alone,' he
used to say.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_18" id="Ref_18" href="#Foot_18">[18]</a></span>
At one time, he gave thanks to God;
at another, taking the precious volumes from the
shelves around him, he opened and read them, assuaging
the thirst for knowledge which consumed him. A
learned retreat, like that now given him, was the dream
of his whole life. Pious reflections crowded into his
heart, and if during his flight he had felt a momentary
darkness, the light now shone into his soul. 'The
causes of what happens to us are often so hidden,' he
said in after times, 'that human affairs seem to turn
about at random, as on a wheel, and the flesh tempts
us to murmur against God, because he sports with
men, tossing them here and there like balls, ... but
the issue shows us that God is on the watch for the
salvation of believers.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_19" id="Ref_19" href="#Foot_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=DOXOPOLIS.=</p>

<p>A new epoch, a new phase, was beginning for Calvin:
he was leaving school, he was about to enter upon
life, and a pause was necessary. The future reformer,
before rushing into the storms of an agitated career,
was to be tempered anew in the fire of the divine
Word and of prayer. Great struggles awaited him: the
Church was waking up from the slumber of death,
throwing back the winding-sheet of popery, and rising
from the sepulchre. One universal cry was heard
among all the nations of the West. At Worms, a monk
had demanded the Holy Scriptures of God in presence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
of the imperial diet; a priest had demanded them at
Zurich; students had demanded them at Cambridge;
at Spire, an assembly of princes had declared that they
would hear nothing but the preaching of that heavenly
Word; and its life-bearing doctrines had been solemnly
confessed at Augsburg in the presence of Charles V.
Germany, Switzerland, England, the Low Countries,
Italy—all Europe, in a word, was stirred at the sight
of that new faith which had come forth from the tomb
of ages.... France herself was moved. How could a
young man so modest, so timid, who feared so much
all contact with the passions of men—how could
Calvin battle for the faith, if he did not receive in the
retirement of the wilderness the baptism of the Spirit
and of fire?</p>

<p>And this baptism he received. Alone and forced to
hide himself, he experienced an inward peace and
joy he had never known before. 'By the exercise
of the cross,' he said, 'the Son of God receives us
<i>into his order</i>, and makes us partakers of his glory.'
Accordingly he gave a very extraordinary name to
the obscure town of Angoulême: he called it <i>Doxopolis</i>,
the city of glory, and thus he dated his letters.
How pleasant and glorious this retirement proved
to him! He had found his Wartburg, his <i>Patmos</i>,
and unable any longer to hide from his friends the
happiness he enjoyed, he wrote to Francis Daniel of
Orleans: 'Why cannot I have a moment's talk with
you?' he said, 'not indeed to trouble you with my
disputes and struggles; why should I do so? I think
that what interests you more just now is to know
that I am well, and that, if you take into account
my known <i>indolence</i>, I am making progress in my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
studies.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_20" id="Ref_20" href="#Foot_20">[20]</a></span>
Then after speaking of Du Tillet's kindness,
of his own responsibility, and of the use he ought
to make of his leisure ... the joy which filled his
heart ran over, and he exclaimed with thankfulness:
'Oh! how happy I should think myself, if the peace
which I now enjoy should continue during the time of
my retirement and exile.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_21" id="Ref_21" href="#Foot_21">[21]</a></span>
The Lord, whose providence
foresees everything, will provide. Experience has
taught me that we cannot see much beforehand what
will happen to us. At the very moment when I promised
myself repose, the storm burst suddenly upon me.
And then, when I thought some horrible den would
be my lot, a quiet <i>nest</i> was unexpectedly prepared for
me.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_22" id="Ref_22" href="#Foot_22">[22]</a></span>
... It is the hand of God that hath done this.
Only let us trust in him, and he will care for us!'
Thus the hunted Calvin found himself at Angoulême,
under God's hand, like a young storm-driven bird
that has taken refuge in the nest under the wing of
its mother.</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN'S LABOURS.=</p>

<p>The young canon took the liveliest interest in the
fate of his guest, and hoped to see the hospitality he
showed him bear precious fruits for learning and
the Gospel. Calvin, too humble to believe that Du
Tillet's cares had any reference to himself, ascribed
them solely to his friend's zeal for knowledge and the
cause of Christ; it seemed to him that he could never
repay such kindness but by constant labour, and that
was all he ever had to give. 'My protector's kindness,'
he said, 'is sufficient to stimulate the indolence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
of the laziest of men.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_23" id="Ref_23" href="#Foot_23">[23]</a></span>
Cheer up, then! let me make
an effort, let me struggle earnestly. No more carelessness!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_24" id="Ref_24" href="#Foot_24">[24]</a></span>
Then he shut himself up in Du Tillet's
library, gathered round him the books he wanted, and
said: 'I must give all my attention to study; this
thought is constantly pulling me by the ear.' If he
took a moment's leisure, he felt 'his ear pulled,' that
is to say, his conscience was troubled; he hurried to
his books, and set to work with so much zeal, 'that he
passed whole nights without sleeping and days without eating.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_25" id="Ref_25" href="#Foot_25">[25]</a></span>
This was his <i>indolence</i>!</p>

<p>A great idea was at that time growing in his heart.
Parliament accused and even burnt his brethren for
pretended heresies. 'Must I be silent,' he said, 'and
thus give unbelievers an opportunity of condemning
a doctrine they do not know? Why should not
the Reformed have a confession to lay before their
adversaries?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_26" id="Ref_26" href="#Foot_26">[26]</a></span>
As he examined Du Tillet's library,
he came upon certain books which seemed to him
to bear particularly on the existing state of suffering
among evangelical christians. He saw that apologies
had formerly been presented to the Emperor Adrian
by Quadratus and Aristides, to Antoninus by Justin
Martyr, and to Marcus Aurelius by Athenagoras.
Ought not the friends of the Reformation to present a
similar defence to Francis I.? If Calvin's mouth is
shut, he will take up the pen. God was then setting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
him apart for one of the great works of the age. He
did not indeed compose his <i>Christian Institutes</i> at
this time, even under the elementary form of the first
edition, but he meditated it; he searched the Scriptures;
he drew out the sketch, and perhaps wrote
some passages of that work, the finest produced by
the Reformation. And hence one of the enemies of
the Reform, casting a severe look on the learned
library of the Du Tillets, was led to exclaim: 'This
is the forge where the new <i>Vulcan</i> prepared the bolts
that he was afterwards to scatter on every side....
That is the factory where he began to make the
nets that he afterwards fixed up to catch the simple,
and from which a man must be very clever to get
out. It was there that he wove the web of his
<i>Institutes</i>, which we may call the <i>Koran</i> or the <i>Talmud</i>
of heresy.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_27" id="Ref_27" href="#Foot_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=MATERIALISTS.=</p>

<p>While Calvin was writing his first notes, he heard
some strange rumours. Men spoke to him of certain
materialists in whose opinion the soul died with the
body. At first he hesitated as to what he should do.
'How,' he asked, 'can I join battle with adversaries of
whose camp and arms and tactics I know nothing, and
of whom I have only heard some confused murmur?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_28" id="Ref_28" href="#Foot_28">[28]</a></span>
Another consideration checked him. Allied to them
were Christians who, while rejecting these errors, said
that <i>time</i> did not exist for the soul separated from the
body, and that the moment of death was followed
instantly by the moment of resurrection. 'I should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
not like these good people to be offended against me,'
he said. Calvin refused to fire a shot against his
enemies lest he should wound his brethren.</p>

<p>But one day he was told of enormous and degrading
sophisms. These teachers said to their followers:
'God has not placed in man a soul different from that
of the beast. The soul is not a substance; it is only
a quality of life, which proceeds from the throbbing
of the arteries or the motion of the lungs. It cannot
exist without the body, and perishes with it, until man
rises again whole.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_29" id="Ref_29" href="#Foot_29">[29]</a></span>
Calvin was thunderstruck. To
be a man and to rank yourself among beasts, seemed
to him foolish and impious. 'O God!' he exclaimed,
'the conflagration has increased, and thrown out
flakes which, spreading far and wide, have turned to
burning torches.... O Lord, extinguish them, we pray
thee, by that saving rain which thou reservest for
thy Church!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_30" id="Ref_30" href="#Foot_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>It was this gross materialism which absorbed Calvin's
attention at Angoulême. He saw the evil which these
teachers might do the Reform, and shuddered at the
thought of the dangers which threatened the simple.
'Poor reeds tossed by every wind,' he exclaimed,
'whom the slightest breath shakes and bends, what
will become of you?'... Then addressing the materialists
he said: 'When the Lord says that the wicked
kill the body but <i>cannot kill the soul</i>, does he not mean
that the soul survives after death?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_31" id="Ref_31" href="#Foot_31">[31]</a></span>
Know you not that, according to Scripture, the souls of the saints
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
stand before the throne of God, and that white robes
were given unto every one of them?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_32" id="Ref_32" href="#Foot_32">[32]</a></span>
Then resorting to irony, he continued: 'Sleepy souls, what, I pray,
do you understand by these <i>white robes</i>? Do you take
them for <i>pillows</i> on which the souls recline that are
condemned to die?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_33" id="Ref_33" href="#Foot_33">[33]</a></span>
This mode of arguing was not
rare in the sixteenth century. Calvin, agitated by
these errors, took up his pen, and committed to paper
the reflections which he published shortly after.</p>

<p>Calvin loved to repose from these struggles on the
bosom of friendship. In the society of Du Tillet at
Angoulême he found once more the charms which that
of Duchemin had procured for him at Orleans. All
his life he sought that noble intercourse, those <i>offices</i>,
those kindnesses which friendship procures.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_34" id="Ref_34" href="#Foot_34">[34]</a></span>
Even when deep in study, he loved to see the library door
open, a well-known face appear, and a friend sit
down by his side. Their conversations had an inexpressible

<p class="drop-cap">BY degrees, however, Calvin came out of his retirement.
Shut up in his library, he began to sigh
for country air, like Luther in the Wartburg. He
went out sometimes, alone or with his friend, and
rambled over the hills and quiet meadows watered by
the Charente. The neighbourhood of Angoulême
did not present the grandeur he was one day to find
on the shores of the Leman; but to him everything
in creation was beautiful, because he saw the Creator
everywhere. He could even be profoundly touched
by the beauties of nature: 'In the presence of the
works of God,' he said, 'we are overcome with astonishment,
and our tongues and senses fail us.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_36" id="Ref_36" href="#Foot_36">[36]</a></span>
Not far from the city was a vineyard belonging to the
canon, to which Du Tillet one day conducted his
friend. The delighted Calvin returned there frequently;
the remembrance of these visits still lingers
in those parts, and the vineyard still goes by the name
of <i>La Calvine</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_37" id="Ref_37" href="#Foot_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>About this time their circle was increased: John Du
Tillet, afterwards bishop of Meaux, arrived at Angoulême.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
He too became attached with his whole heart
to Calvin: the latter, wishing to make himself useful
to the two brothers, offered to teach them Greek, and
while teaching them to read the New Testament, he
led them to seek Christ. John listened greedily to
the young doctor's words; hence he was long suspected
by the Romanists, and having published in
1549 a very old manuscript, ascribed to Charlemagne,
<i>Against Images</i>—the <i>Libri Carolini</i> are known to
be opposed to them—he occasioned loud murmurs:
'A man who has been Calvin's pupil,' said the famous
Cardinal du Perron, 'cannot well have any other
opinion.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_38" id="Ref_38" href="#Foot_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN AT CLAIX.=</p>

<p>These lessons, begun at Angoulême, were continued
at Claix, where Du Tillet used to spend a part of the
year. People asked in the village who that short,
thin, pale young man was, who looked so serious and
meek, and whom they often met with the Du Tillets.
The best informed said that he gave them lessons in
Greek. This study was a thing so extraordinary in
the Angoumois, that the country people, ignorant of
the professor's name, called him the <i>Greek of Claix</i>,
or the <i>little Greek</i>. Some of the better people of the
neighbourhood of Claix occasionally met the friends:
they entered into conversation, and, says a contemporary,
'all who loved learning esteemed the young scholar;'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_39" id="Ref_39" href="#Foot_39">[39]</a></span>
his knowledge of the classics, his taste so
fine and accurate, attracted them to him. Certain
friends of the Du Tillets, ecclesiastics of good family,
men of letters and of feeling, soon shared this admiration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
of his virtues and his talents: they were
Anthony de Chaillou, Prior of Bouteville, the Abbot of
Balsac (near Jarnac), the famous De la Place, the
Sieur de Torsac, Charles Girault, and others. Calvin's
appearance, his simple dress and modest look interested
these good men at first sight; and that clear
and penetrating glance which he preserved until the
last, soon revealed to them the keen intelligence and
uprightness of the young <i>Greek</i>. They conceived
the most hearty affection for him. They loved to
hear him speak of the Saviour and of heaven, and
yielded to his evangelical teaching without a thought
of being faithless to that of the Church. This was
the case with many Catholics at that time. They did
not find in Calvin the things that make fine talkers
in the world—'nonsense, merry jests, bantering, jokes,
and all sorts of foolery, which pass away in smoke,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_40" id="Ref_40" href="#Foot_40">[40]</a></span>
but the charms and profitableness of his conversation
captivated all who heard him. De la Place in particular
received a deep impression: 'I shall never forget,' he
wrote years after, 'how your conversation made me
better, when we were together at Angoulême. Oh!
what shall I give you in this mortal life for the immortal
life that I then received?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_41" id="Ref_41" href="#Foot_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN'S FRIENDS.=</p>

<p>The frequent visits paid to the <i>Greek</i> by persons of
consideration were soon remarked by the clergy; on
the other hand, Bouteville desired to substitute more
regular conferences for these simple conversations.
He lived at the castle of Gérac, situated in a less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
frequented district.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_42" id="Ref_42" href="#Foot_42">[42]</a></span>
'Come to my house,' he said
to his friends, 'and let each of us state freely his
convictions and objections.' Calvin hesitated about
going: 'he was fond of solitude, and spoke little in
company;' but the thought of bringing his friends to
the Gospel decided him.</p>

<p class="side">=CONFERENCES AT GÉRAC.=</p>

<p>One day, therefore, the modest doctor appeared in
the midst of the Prior of Bouteville's guests; one idea
had absorbed him on the road to Gérac. He thought
that 'truth is not a common thing; that it rises far
above the capacity of the human understanding, and
that we ought to purchase it at any price.' At last
when he joined his friends, after mutual greetings had
been exchanged, he spoke to them of the subject that
filled his heart. He opened the Bible, placed his hand
on it, and said, 'Let us find the truth!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_43" id="Ref_43" href="#Foot_43">[43]</a></span>
... 'The whole conference,' says Florimond Rémond, a staunch
Catholic, 'had no other object but <i>the investigation of
truth</i>, a phrase which he had generally in his mouth.'
Calvin, however, did not set himself up as an oracle:
addressing the conscience, he showed that Christ
answered all the wants of the soul; the conversation
soon became animated, his friends bringing forward objections.
He never was at a loss; 'having a marvellous
facility,' they said, 'in penetrating suddenly the greatest
difficulties and clearing them up.' The visitors of
Gérac departed joyfully to their homes.</p>

<p>After these conferences, Calvin returned quietly to
his retreat, and prayed for those to whom he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
spoken and for others besides. 'If sometimes we are
cold in prayer,' he said, 'let us at once remember how
many of our brethren are sinking under heavy burdens
and grievous troubles; how many are oppressed by
great anguish in their hearts and in all extremity of
evils.... We must have hearts of iron or steel, if
such sluggishness in prayer cannot then be expelled
from our bosoms.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_44" id="Ref_44" href="#Foot_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Calvin felt the necessity of giving a solid foundation
to the faith of his friends. 'A tree that is not deeply
rooted,' he said, 'is easily torn up by the first blast of
the storm.' He then committed to paper, as we have
said, the first ideas of his <i>Christian Institutes</i>. One
day, as he was starting for Gérac, he took his notes with
him, and read what he had just written to the circle
assembled in the castle.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_45" id="Ref_45" href="#Foot_45">[45]</a></span>
He did this several times
afterwards; but the notes served merely as a text on
which he commented with much eloquence. 'No one
can equal him,' they said, 'in loftiness of language,
conciseness of arrangement, and majesty of style.'
He was not content with stating this doctrine or that:
His fine understanding grasped the organic unity of
the Christian truths, and he was able to present them
as a divine whole.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_46" id="Ref_46" href="#Foot_46">[46]</a></span>
It was no doubt the cry of his
conscience which had led him to seek salvation in the
Holy Scriptures; but he had not been able to study,
compare, and fathom them without his understanding
becoming enlightened, developed, and sanctified. The
moral faculty is that which is first aroused in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
Christian; but it immediately provokes the exercise
of the intellectual faculties. The citizens of the
kingdom of God are not those who know, but those
who believe; not the learned, but the regenerated.
A church in which the intellectual faculty is above
the moral faculty, does not bear the stamp of the Protestant
and Christian principle; but every church in
which the divine faculty of the understanding is
neglected, and where learning is viewed with distrust,
will easily fall into deplorable error.</p>

<p>Calvin's explanations, so deep and yet so clear, were
not without their use. Du Tillet, Chaillou, De la
Place, Torsac, and others mutually expressed their
admiration and joy after the young doctor had retired;
then, at their homes and apart from the world,
they meditated on the consoling truths they had heard.
Many of the most notable men of the district were
won over to evangelical convictions.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_47" id="Ref_47" href="#Foot_47">[47]</a></span>
The Prior of Bouteville, in particular, showed from that time so
much faith and zeal—he was, after Calvin's departure,
so much the father and guide of those who had
received the seed of truth, that he was called throughout
the province: 'The Lutherans' Pope.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_48" id="Ref_48" href="#Foot_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Calvin's sphere widened gradually: he wrote to
those to whom he could not speak;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_49" id="Ref_49" href="#Foot_49">[49]</a></span>
and ere long his
friends asked why they should keep for themselves
alone the bread of life on which they fed?... One
of them giving utterance to this thought to the young
doctor added: 'But you can only reach the people in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
the churches.' It was scarcely possible that Calvin, a
fugitive from Paris, could visit the churches of the
Angoumois as an evangelical missionary. 'Compose
some short Christian exhortations for us,' said his
friends to him, 'and we will give them to well-disposed
parish priests to read to their congregations.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_50" id="Ref_50" href="#Foot_50">[50]</a></span>
He did so, and humble clerks read these evangelical appeals
from their pulpits, as well as they could. Thus
Calvin preached through the mouths of priests to poor
villagers, as he had addressed the imposing Sorbonne
by the mouth of the rector.</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN PROVIDES SERMONS.=</p>

<p>This encouraged certain church dignitaries, especially
the prior, who were at once his disciples and his
patrons. If Calvin could not preach in French, why
should he not teach in Latin? They surrounded the
young doctor, representing to him that Latin, the
language of the Roman Church, could not occasion
any scandal, and asked him to deliver some Latin
orations before the clergy. Calvin, firmly convinced
that the reform ought to begin with the teaching of
the priest, preached several Latin sermons in St.
Peter's Church.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_51" id="Ref_51" href="#Foot_51">[51]</a></span>
In this way he inaugurated his
career as a reformer. All this could not be done
without giving rise to murmurs. The faithful
followers of Rome complained of him, of the prior,
of all his friends, and this opposition might become
dangerous. 'Fatal instrument,' says a Romanist with
reference to Calvin's stay in the Angoumois, 'which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
was destined to reduce France to greater extremities
than the Saracens, the Germans, the English, and the
house of Austria had done.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_52" id="Ref_52" href="#Foot_52">[52]</a></span>
He was not, however,
the only one who was assisting in this excellent work.</p>

<p class="side">=RELIGIOUS AWAKENING IN THE SOUTH.=</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WHILE Francis I. was endeavouring to stifle the
Reformation in the north of France, it was
spreading in the south, and many souls were converted
in the districts bordering the Pyrenees. Evangelical
Christians of other countries, some of whom
were ministers, had taken refuge there, and 'towns
and villages were <i>perverted</i> suddenly by hearing a
single sermon,' says a Roman Catholic historian. On
certain days, the simple peasants and even a few
townspeople, arriving by different paths, would meet
in a retired spot, in the bed of some dried-up torrent
or in a cavern of the mountain. They had often to
wait a long time for the preacher; the priests and
their creatures forced him to make a wide circuit;
sometimes he did not come at all. 'Then,' says a
Catholic, 'women might be seen trampling on the
modesty of their sex, taking a Bible, reading it and
even assuming the boldness to interpret it, while
waiting for the minister.'</p>

<p>At this epoch the Queen of Navarre arrived in the
south. The noise caused in 1533 by the rector's sermon
and Calvin's disappearance, had induced her to
quit St. Germain for the states of her husband. Her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
brother the king was then at a distance from Paris;
her nieces with their governesses, Mesdames de Brissac
and De Montreal, and the somewhat gloomy and oppressive
etiquette which prevailed at the court of
Queen Eleanor of Portugal, was not much to the taste
of the lively and intelligent Margaret of Navarre.
She therefore started for Nérac. Two litters with
six mules, three baggage mules, and three or four
carriages for the queen's women<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_53" id="Ref_53" href="#Foot_53">[53]</a></span>
entered the city,
and took the road that leads to the vast Gothic castle
of the D'Albrets. It was a very scanty retinue for
the sister of Francis I.</p>

<p class="side">=QUEEN MARGARET AT NÉRAC.=</p>

<p>Margaret alighted from her litter, and was hardly
settled in her apartments before she felt quite happy,
for she had escaped at last from the pomps and
struggles of the court of France. She laid aside her
showy dresses and her grand manners; she hid the
majesty of her house beneath a candour and friendliness
that enchanted all who came near her. Dressed
like a plain gentlewoman, she quitted the castle,
crossed the Baise which flows through the city, and
rambled along the beautiful walks of the neighbourhood,
having for companions only the seneschaless of
Poitou or one of her young ladies of honour. But
she had come for something more than this. Having
fled far from the palaces and cities where the persecuting
spirit of Rome and of the parliament was
raging, she occupied herself more particularly in
giving a fresh impulse to the evangelical movement
in the southern provinces. Her activity was inexhaustible.
She sent out <i>colporteurs</i> who made their
way into houses, and while selling jewellery to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
young women, presented them also with New Testaments,
printed in fine characters, ruled in red and
bound in vellum with gilt edges. 'The mere sight
of these books,' says an historian, 'excited a desire
to read them.' Around the queen everybody was
in motion, labouring and murmuring like a hive
of bees. 'Margaret,' says the king's historiographer,
'was the precious flower that adorned this parterre,
and whose perfume attracted the best spirits of
Europe to Bearn, as thyme attracts honey-bees.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_54" id="Ref_54" href="#Foot_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>The queen might often be seen surrounded by a
troop of sufferers, to whom she showed the tenderest
respect. These were the refugees: Lefèvre of Etaples,
Gerard Roussel, converted priests and monks, and a
number of laymen, obliged to leave France, which
they had been able to do, thanks to the queen who
had assisted their flight. 'The good princess,' said
a Catholic, 'has really nothing more at heart than to
get those out of the way whom the king wishes to
deliver up to the severities of justice. If I attempted
to give the names of all those whom she has saved
from punishment, I should never finish.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_55" id="Ref_55" href="#Foot_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>The Christians exiled for the Gospel did not make
her forget the wretched of her own country. One day,
when Roussel was describing to her the unfortunate
situation of a poor family, Margaret said nothing; but
returning to her chamber, she threw a Bearnese hood
over her shoulders, and, followed by a single domestic,
went out by a private door, hastened to the sufferers,
and comforted them with the tenderest affection.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_56" id="Ref_56" href="#Foot_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></div>

<p>She took pleasure in founding schools. Roussel,
her chaplain, would visit the humble room in which
the children of the people were learning to read and
write, and going up to them would say: 'My dear
children ... the death of Christ is a real atonement.
There is no sin so small as not to need it, or so great
that it cannot be blotted out by it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_57" id="Ref_57" href="#Foot_57">[57]</a></span>
Praying to God,'
he would add, 'is not muttering with the lips: prayer
is an ardent and serious converse with the Lord.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_58" id="Ref_58" href="#Foot_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN AND ROUSSEL.=</p>

<p>There was one feature, however, in this awakening
in the south which, in Calvin's eyes, rendered it imperfect
and transitory, unless some remedy were
applied to it. There was in it a certain halting
between truth and error. The pious but weak Roussel
manifested a lamentable spirit of compromise in his
teaching. Wearied with the struggles he had gone
through, he sheltered himself under the cloak of the
Catholic Church. He did not pray to the Virgin, he
administered the Holy Sacrament in two kinds; but
he celebrated a kind of mass—a mournful and yet
touching instance of that mixed Christianity which
aimed at preserving evangelical life under catholic
forms.</p>

<p>Calvin at Angoulême was not far from Nérac, and
his eyes were often turned to that city. He longed to
see Lefèvre before the old man was taken from the
world, and was uneasy about Roussel, whom he feared
to see yielding to the seductions of greatness. One
of the christian thoughts that had laid the strongest
hold on his mind, was the conviction that the wisdom
from on high ought to reject every compromise suggested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
by ambition or hypocrisy.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_59" id="Ref_59" href="#Foot_59">[59]</a></span>
Ought he not
to try and bring back Roussel into the right path from
which he appeared to be wandering? Calvin left
Du Tillet's house probably about the end of February,
and called upon Roussel as soon as he arrived at
Nérac.</p>

<p>The most decided and the most moderate of the
theologians of the sixteenth century were now face to
face. Calvin, naturally timid and hesitating, 'would
never have had the boldness so much as to open his
mouth (to use his own words); but faith in Christ
begot such a strong assurance in his heart, that he
could not remain silent.' He, therefore, gave his
opinion with decision: 'There is no good left in
Catholicism,' he said. 'We must re-establish the
Church in its ancient purity.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_60" id="Ref_60"
href="#Foot_60">[60]</a></span>—'What is that you
say?' answered the astonished Roussel; 'God's house
ought to be purified, no doubt, but not destroyed.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_61" id="Ref_61"
href="#Foot_61">[61]</a></span>—'Impossible,'
said the young reformer; 'the edifice is
so bad that it cannot be repaired. We must pull it
down entirely, and build another in its place.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_62" id="Ref_62"
href="#Foot_62">[62]</a></span>—Roussel
exclaimed with alarm: 'We must cleanse the
Church, but not by setting it on fire. If we take
upon ourselves to pull it down, we shall be crushed
under the ruins.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_63" id="Ref_63" href="#Foot_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Calvin retired in sorrow. Type of protestant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
decision in the sixteenth century, he always protested
freely and boldly against everything that was contrary
to the Gospel. He displayed this unshakeable firmness
not only in opposition to catholic tendencies, but
also against rationalistic ideas. It would not be difficult
to find in Zwingle, in Melanchthon, and even in
Luther, some sprinkling of neology, of which the
slightest traces cannot be found in Calvin.</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN AND LEFÈVRE.=</p>

<p>Nérac, as we have said, sheltered another teacher—an
old man whom age might have made weaker than
Roussel, but who under his white hair and decrepid
appearance concealed a living force, to be suddenly
revived by contact with the great faith of the young
scholar. Calvin asked for Lefèvre's house: everybody
knew him: 'He is a little bit of a man, old as Herod,
but lively as gunpowder,' they told him.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_64" id="Ref_64" href="#Foot_64">[64]</a></span>
As we have seen, Lefèvre had professed the great doctrine
of justification by faith, even before Luther; but after
so many years, the aged doctor still indulged in the
vain hope of seeing Catholicism reform itself. 'There
ought to be only one Church,' he would frequently repeat,
and this idea prevented his separation from Rome.
Nevertheless, his spiritualist views permitted him to
preserve the unity of charity with all who loved Christ.</p>

<p>When Calvin was admitted into his presence, he
discerned the great man under his puny stature, and
was caught by the charm which he exercised over all
who came near him. What mildness, what depth,
what knowledge, modesty, candour, loftiness, piety,
moral grandeur, and holiness, had been said of him!<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_65" id="Ref_65" href="#Foot_65">[65]</a></span>
It seemed as if all these virtues illuminated the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
man with heavenly brightness just as the night of the
grave was about to cover him with its darkness. On
his side, the young man pleased Lefèvre, who began
to tell him how the opposition of the Sorbonne had
compelled him to take refuge in the south, 'in order,'
as he said, 'to escape the bloody hands of those
doctors.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_66" id="Ref_66" href="#Foot_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Calvin endeavoured to remove the old man's illusions.
He showed him that we must receive everything
from the Word and from the grace of God. He
spoke with clearness, with decision, and with energy.
Lefèvre was moved—he reflected a little and weeping
exclaimed: 'Alas! I know the truth, but I keep myself
apart from those who profess it.' Recovering,
however, from his trouble, he wiped his eyes, and seeing
his young fellow-countryman 'rejecting all the
fetters of this world and preparing to fight under the
banner of Jesus,' he examined him more attentively,
and asked himself if he had not before him that future
reformer whom he had once foretold:<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_67" id="Ref_67" href="#Foot_67">[67]</a></span>
'Young man,' he said, 'you will be one day a powerful instrument
in the Lord's hand.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_68" id="Ref_68" href="#Foot_68">[68]</a></span>...
The world will obstinately
resist Jesus Christ, and everything will seem to conspire
against the Son of God; but stand firm on that
rock, and many will be broken against it. God will
make use of you to restore the kingdom of heaven in
France.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_69" id="Ref_69" href="#Foot_69">[69]</a></span>
In 1509 Luther, being of the same age as
Calvin in 1534, heard a similar prophecy from the
mouth of a venerable doctor.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span></p>

<p>Yet, if we may believe a catholic historian, the old
man did not stop there. His eyes, resting with kindness
on the young man, expressed a certain fear. He
fancied he saw a young horse which, however admirable
its spirit, might dash beyond all restraint.
'Be on your guard,' he added, 'against the extreme
ardour of your mind.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_70" id="Ref_70" href="#Foot_70">[70]</a></span>
Take Melanchthon as your
pattern, and let your strength be always tempered
with charity.' The old man pressed the young
man's hand, and they parted never to see each other
again.</p>

<p>Did Calvin see the Queen of Navarre also? It does
not appear that Margaret was living at Nérac at that
time; but he had some relations with her. It has
been said that she felt an interest in his exile;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_71" id="Ref_71" href="#Foot_71">[71]</a></span>
and it is possible that she had some share in the resolution
he soon formed of quitting the south. She may have
assured him that he had nothing to fear in Paris, if
he committed no imprudence. But we have found
nothing certain on these points.</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN REBUKES THE UNEQUALLY YOKED.=</p>

<p>For the present, Calvin returned to Du Tillet's.
The visits made to Roussel and Lefèvre had taught
him a lesson. He comprehended that it was not only
souls blindly submissive to Rome that incurred imminent
danger; he conceived the liveliest alarm for
those minds which floated between the pope and the
Word of God, either through weakness or want of
light. He saw that as the limit between the two
churches was not yet clearly traced, some of those who
belonged to Rome were lingering beneath the fresh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
and verdant shades of the Gospel, while others who
ought to belong to the Reformation still wandered beneath
the gothic arches of Romish cathedrals and prostrated
themselves at the foot of Romish altars. This
state of things—possibly approved of by many—Calvin
thought dangerous, and his principles going farther,
he undertook 'to rebuke freely (as he says) those who
yoked with unbelievers, keeping them company in
outward idolatry.'<span

 <h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">A DRAMATIC REPRESENTATION AT THE COURT
 OF NAVARRE.<br />
 (<span class="smc">Winter of 1533-34.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HENRY and Margaret having quitted Nérac for
Pau, where they intended passing the winter,
had reached those picturesque heights, separated by a
ravine, on which the city stands, and had entered the
castle. The queen had found pleasure in adorning it
with the most magnificent gardens then known in
Europe, and liked to walk in them, conversing with
Cardinal de Foix, the Bishop of Tarbes, and many other
distinguished persons who admired her wit and grace.
And yet these ecclesiastics often caused her 'much
vexation.' Surrounded by persons who made a regular
report to Francis I., watched by the king her husband
and the dignitaries of the Church who were at her
court, this pious but weak woman bent under the
weight. She began the day by attending morning
service in the catholic church of the parish; then in the
afternoon she privately collected in her chamber the
evangelical members of her court, and the little band
of exiles, with a few men and women of the people who,
coming forward awkwardly, took their seats timidly
on the handsome furniture of the queen. Roussel,
Lefèvre, or some other minister, delivered an exhortation,
and the little assembly separated, feeling that God
had really been present in the midst of them.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_73" id="Ref_73" href="#Foot_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></div>

<p class="side">=THE LORD'S SUPPER AT PAU.=</p>

<p>One day some of these humble believers desired to
partake of the Lord's Supper. The queen was embarrassed:
she did not dare celebrate it in the church,
nor even in her own room, lest one of the cardinals
should enter suddenly.... After some reflection Margaret
thought she had found what was wanted. Under the
terrace of the castle there was a large hall called <i>the
Mint</i>, a secret underground place that could be approached
without attracting notice. By the queen's
orders her servants privately carried a table there,
covered it with a white cloth, and placed a basin on it
containing 'a few slices of plain bread,' and by its side
some cups full of wine 'instead of chalices.'—'Such
are their altars!' ironically exclaims the catholic
historian.</p>

<p>On the appointed day, the believers, silent and
agitated, came and took their places not without fear
of being discovered. The queen, forgetting the pomps
of the Louvre, sat down among them as a simple
Christian. Roussel appeared, but not in sacerdotal
costume, and stood in front of the table. 'Those who
believe that there is nothing but an empty sign in the
Sacrament,' he said, 'are not of the school of faith.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_74" id="Ref_74" href="#Foot_74">[74]</a></span>
He took common bread, says the indignant catholic
narrator, 'and not little round wafers stamped with
images.'—'Remember,' continued Roussel with a
grave voice, 'that Christ suffered and died for us.'
He then handed round the cup 'without making
the sign of the cross!' The worshippers, deeply
moved, bore a heavenly expression on their faces and
felt the presence of the Lord: 'The same Christ
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
dwelt in the minister and in the people.' No spy
nor cardinal appeared, and the communicants, after
presenting an offering for the poor, withdrew in peace.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_75" id="Ref_75" href="#Foot_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding its secresy, this celebration was
talked about in the castle. The King of Navarre was
quite annoyed at it. A thoughtless, changeable, and
ever violent man, and liable to occasional worldly relapses,
he began to grow impatient at his wife's piety,
and especially at the 'feastings in the cellar.' He
was habitually in a bad humour, and found fault with
all that Margaret did.</p>

<p>One day as he returned to the castle from a hunting-party,
he asked where the queen was. He was
told that a minister was preaching in her chamber.
At these words the king's face flushed. A faithful
servant ran to warn the queen: ministers and hearers
escaped by a back way, and they had hardly left the
room, when Henry entered abruptly. He stopped,
looked round him, and seeing only the queen, agitated
and trembling, he struck her in the face, saying:
'Madame, you desire to know too much.' He then
left her indignant and confounded. This affront
offered to the dignity of the royal family of France
did not pass unnoticed: Francis 'scolded Henry
d'Albret soundly,' says Brantôme.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_76" id="Ref_76" href="#Foot_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE MYSTERY OF THE NATIVITY.=</p>

<p>Margaret, eager to win over her husband and to be
agreeable to her court, resolved to have a representation
of some biblical dramas. Possibly she might
by this means reach those who would not come to
the sermons. She took for her subject <i>The Birth</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
<i>of the Saviour</i>, and having completed her poem
distributed the parts among certain noble maidens.
These biblical representations, which displeased Calvin,
because of their theatrical form, and the Romish
clergy because of their evangelical truths, charmed
the middle party, and as they belong to the religious
history of the epoch, we cannot pass them by unnoticed.
Margaret fitted up the great hall of the
castle as a theatre. The scenery was prepared, and
shortly after Christmas placards announced the representation
of 'The Nativity of Jesus Christ.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_77" id="Ref_77" href="#Foot_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>When the day came the hall was crowded. In the
front rank of the amphitheatre sat the king and
queen, the latter wearing a plain dress trimmed with
marten's fur and a Bearnese hood. Near them were
the Cardinals De Grammont and De Foix with other
members of the clergy. Around the royal pair
were Margaret's inseparable maids of honour—Mademoiselle
de St. Pather, the usual distributor of
her alms, Mademoiselle de la Batenage, Blanche de
Tournon, Françoise de Clermont, Madame d'Avangour,
the greatest 'eaves-dropper' of the court, the chancellor,
chamberlains, and almoners. Her ten stewards,
her esquires and thirty-eight maids, her seventeen
secretaries, and her twenty valets-de-chambre were
most of them present.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_78" id="Ref_78" href="#Foot_78">[78]</a></span>
The invited strangers occupied
seats according to their rank. A first representation
has rarely excited more curiosity.</p>

<p class="side">=THE MYSTERY-PLAY.=</p>

<p>The first act begins. The scene is placed at
Nazareth, in the house of a poor carpenter. A man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
in the prime of life and a young woman are talking
together. A proclamation has just been published
in the market-place ordering every one to go to the
city of their family to be registered. But these poor
people belong to Bethlehem, and Bethlehem is a
long way from Nazareth. The woman is soon to
become a mother, and the man is uneasy about the
consequences of the journey. The young Israelitish
woman, whose calm meek features indicate the serenity
of a pious soul, says to him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">

<div class="verse">... Us no danger shall come nigh,</div>
<div class="verse">For He whose power o'ershadowed me,</div>
<div class="verse">Holds in his hand both fruit and tree.<span
     class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_79" id="Ref_79" href="#Foot_79">[79]</a></span></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The scene changes, and we are at Bethlehem. It is
quite dark, but a few lights are visible through the
windows of the houses. The same man and woman—they
are Joseph and Mary—have just arrived from
Nazareth after a fatiguing journey. Joseph, still
anxious, begins:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">

<div class="verse">It is late and already night ...</div>
<div class="verse">Let us approach the nearest light.</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="nodent">He knocks at the door, and asks to be admitted. The
owner of the house looks contemptuously on them
and says that he lodges none but rich people. Joseph
goes a little farther on and knocks at another door:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">

<div class="verse">Will you please lodge my wife and me?</div>
<div class="verse">For the poor woman, as you see,</div>
<div class="verse">Is near her time.</div>

<p class="center small">Here is a man with pleasant look.</p>

<p class="nodent">He speaks to him, but the man is a <i>bon vivant</i>, and

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="nodent">At these words, the startled Joseph looks round him,
and discovering at last a poor stable, which the wind
penetrates on every side, he presses Mary to enter it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

she lies down upon the straw and falls asleep.</p>

<p>The scene changes to heaven. The eyes of the
Lord, which 'look upon the sons of men,' are turned
upon the earth, and are fixed with kindness on Mary,
whose sleep is gentle and peaceful. Then as the
great moment approaches, He orders the angels to
leave heaven and announce to mankind the news of
a great joy. He gives each of them a message;
some are to go to Mary, others to Simeon. The
humblest of them says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza">

<div class="verse indent10">... And I, Lord ...</div>

heaven:</p>

<p class="center small">Glory to Thee, Almighty Lord!</p>

<p class="nodent">And the angels depart upon their mission.</p>

<p>The scene changes, and we are once more in the
stable at Bethlehem. Mary awakes and is still
alone. Her heart is agitated by the most astounding
thoughts: the mystery of God which she discerns
surprises and confounds her.</p>

<p class="nodent">At this moment the angels sent by God arrive: they
enter the wretched stable, filling it with their glory,

<p class="nodent">At this point Joseph returns with the provisions he
has bought; he is distressed at his inability to receive
becomingly this child of heaven, but resolving to give
all that he has, he advances towards the stable. On

<p>This was the end of the first act. The spectators
expressed the interest they felt in the drama, at
once so serious and so holy; and even the Cardinals
De Grammont and De Foix found nothing in it contrary
to the doctrines of the Church. As that was a
time when people were very fond of diversion, joke
and jest followed. Several comic characters appeared
in the interlude, especially a poor monk, who was the
soul of the farce.<span

This was not Margaret's composition:
even the catholics did not charge her with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
it. The jesters retired at last, and the drama proceeded.</p>

<p>The scene represented the fields round Bethlehem,
where shepherds and shepherdesses were keeping
their flocks during the watches of the night. One
shepherd worn out with labour, another with 'hunting
the wolf,' had fallen asleep; some shepherdesses
followed their example; but one shepherd and one
shepherdess were awake and communicating their
thoughts to each other.</p>

<p>The second act being finished, a new interlude was
introduced to make the spectators merry. The jesters
reappeared and recited several rondeaux, always
containing some piquant and unexpected joke, which
called forth the laughter of the audience. The burden
of the <i>virelais</i> (poems composed of very short lines, and
with two rhymes) usually turned on some monk, which
greatly diverted the spectators. The cardinals and

annoyed by the satires.<span

termed 'christianity in disguise.'</p>

 (<span class="smc">Spring 1534.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CALVIN meditated leaving the South. He had
found a retreat in the hour of danger; but as the
storm seemed to blow over, he could go at last from
the place where he had been hidden, and resume a
career that had been so roughly interrupted. He was
not at ease in Angoulême. On the one hand the conversion
of Du Tillet and some of his friends gave rise
to rumours among the clergy and people; and on the
other, certain traditional elements that Margaret and
some of his hearers at Gérac desired to retain, were
displeasing to the reformer. Altars, images, holidays
dedicated to Mary and the saints, confessors and
confession—none of these things appeared to him
scriptural, and he sighed for the time when he could
make the evangelical principle prevail in all its integrity.
He was in the habit of saying: 'Above all
things we must confess our Lord fully, without
shrinking from anything soever.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_89" id="Ref_89" href="#Foot_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN'S PROJECTS.=</p>

<p>Where should he go? His thoughts led him first
to Poitiers, whence he proposed to visit Orleans,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
Paris, and then Germany and Switzerland, to study
and gain knowledge by intercourse with the reformers.
In their conversations at Gérac the Sieur de Torras
had often spoken of Pierre de la Place, who was then
studying at Poitiers. Calvin would also meet there
with Charles le Sage, regent of the university, like
himself a native of Noyon. One consideration restrained
him: Could he leave Du Tillet? 'Where
you go, I will go,' said the young canon; 'my heart
is filled with the faith that animates you.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_90" id="Ref_90" href="#Foot_90">[90]</a></span>
The idea
of enjoying Calvin's society at every moment, and
of seeing in Switzerland and Germany the noble-hearted
men who were reforming the Church, filled
him with joy.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_91" id="Ref_91" href="#Foot_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>The two friends departed: Calvin under the name
of Charles d'Espeville, and Du Tillet under that of
Hautmont, which seems to have been borne by some
members of his family. They arrived (probably
about the end of March 1534) in those plains and
heaths of Poitou where so many great battles had
been fought, and where a humble combatant was
approaching to engage in nobler contests. Few
provinces in France were so well prepared. Abelard,
who had lived in these western districts, had left
behind him some traces of the doubts set forth in his
celebrated treatise, <i>Sic et Non</i> (Yes and No),<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_92" id="Ref_92" href="#Foot_92">[92]</a></span>
on the doctrines of the Church. Here too a writer, unconnected
with the Reform, had attacked the <i>papomania</i>,
and the clergy, who formed (it was said) a third part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
of the population, exasperated the two others by their
avarice and irregularities.</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN AT POITIERS.=</p>

<p>Calvin stayed at Poitiers with Messire Fouquet,
prior of Trois-Moutiers, a learned ecclesiastic, and a
friend of the Du Tillets, who had a house there.
The university was flourishing, it possessed learned
professors, and had a famous library. The desire of
understanding—a feeling springing up everywhere in
France—was particularly felt here. The prior of
Trois-Moutiers conversed with his two guests on the
public disputations that were going on in the university.
This excited Calvin's attention: he went to the
hall, sat down on one of the benches, and listened
attentively. No one, as he looked at this stranger,
would have supposed that under those pale, unattractive
features was hidden one of the heroes who change
the face of the world in the name of truth alone.
Beneath much quibbling and idle trash the young
doctor could see flashes of light here and there.
After the disputation, he called upon those combatants
from whom he had heard the language of christianity;
he stated his own ideas, and ere long the beauty of his
genius and the frankness of his language won them
over. Calvin and these generous men became friends
and visited each other; at length, says an historian,
'they began to take walks together without the city,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_93" id="Ref_93" href="#Foot_93">[93]</a></span>
and as they walked along the banks of the little river
Clain, or rambled over the fields, the young doctor
spoke to them openly of Christ and of eternity.</p>

<p>They did not trouble themselves, indeed, with
scholastic theology and metaphysical formulas: Calvin
aimed at the conquest of their souls. He required in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
every one the formation of a new man, and cared about
nothing else. In the midst of the disheartening
weaknesses and immense necessities of fallen humanity,
a great spiritual restoration must be carried
out; the hour had come, and to accomplish the work
it needed special men invested with power from on
high. Calvin was one of these strong men, whom
God has sent to the aid of human decay. At the
moment of the awakening, after the slumber of the
Middle Ages, the heavenly Father bestowed new
creative forces on mankind. The Gospel, then restored
to the world, possessed a beauty which attracted men's
souls, and an authority which wrought in them an
absolute obedience: these are the two regenerating
elements. All over Europe prophets arose among the
people, but they did not prophesy at their own impulse.
Above them was the sovereign, free, living, supernatural
God who worked in them with supreme power.</p>

<p>Calvin was about to begin at Poitiers a work of
regeneration. Indeed no long time elapsed before
numerous hearers crowded round him. Some were
offended by his words; and there were some who,
looking only for disputations and sophistry, tormented
the young doctor with their accustomed insolence;
while others opposed the heretic 'with dilemmas and
cunning catches.' Others, again, who thought themselves
masters of the world, turned their backs on him,
'as if he were an ordinary mountebank.' Calvin, surprised
at such resistance, 'instead of entangling himself
in useless disputes,' seriously thrust aside these
frivolous subtleties, and 'put forward what is true.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_94" id="Ref_94" href="#Foot_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></div>

<p class="side">=CALVIN'S FRIENDS.=</p>

<p>But if the doctrine he announced met with enemies,
it also met with friends. The word of God perpetually
separates light from darkness in the spiritual
world, as it did at the time of the creation of
heaven and earth. Generous men gathered eagerly
round the young and powerful doctor. These were
Albert Babinot, jurist, poet, and law-reader; Anthony
Veron, procureur to the lower court; Anthony
de la Dugie, doctor-regent; Jean Boisseau de la
Borderie, advocate; Jean Vernou of Poitiers, the
Sieur de St. Vertumien, and Charles le Sage, doctor-regent,
a man of great esteem, who possessed the entire
confidence of Madame, the king's mother.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_95" id="Ref_95" href="#Foot_95">[95]</a></span>
One of these distinguished men especially won Calvin's heart:
it was Pierre de la Place, a native of Angoulême, a
friend of Du Tillet, afterwards president of the Court
of Aids, and one of the St. Bartholomew martyrs.
But Le Sage, another of these eminent men, kept
himself rather aloof; he was from Noyon, and was
not very anxious to put himself in the train of the
son of the old episcopal secretary; moreover, he
believed sincerely in the miracle of transubstantiation.</p>

<p>This group of distinguished men, which now gathered
round Calvin at Poitiers, as formerly at Angoulême,
fixed the attention of those who had any intercourse
with him. Calvin's attractive power, which is somewhat
doubted in the present day, struck even his
enemies. 'Knowledge as well as virtue,' says one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
them on this occasion, 'soon wins love, and eminent
minds, whether for good or evil, require little time to
become known. Calvin, having retired to Poitiers,
soon met with good store of friends.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_96" id="Ref_96" href="#Foot_96">[96]</a></span>
He met them at the university, went to see them at their houses, courted
their society, and spoke freely of the knowledge of God.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_97" id="Ref_97" href="#Foot_97">[97]</a></span>
On many points they thought from the very
first like him. When he complained 'that they worshipped
stocks and stones, prayed to the dead, trusted
in vain things, and desired to serve God by idle ceremonies,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_98" id="Ref_98" href="#Foot_98">[98]</a></span>
everybody agreed with him, even Le Sage.
But the young doctor went still farther. Doubtless
he condemned 'a rugged austerity; he recommended
people to be <i>loving</i> (aimables) and kind to their neighbours.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_99" id="Ref_99" href="#Foot_99">[99]</a></span>
But at the same time, he was true, even at
the risk of displeasing. Being present one day when
some sincere catholics were defending the doctrine
of transubstantiation, Calvin unhesitatingly declared,
that we must receive Christ, even his body and blood,
by faith, by the spirit which gives life, and not by a
sensual eating with the mouth. Le Sage exclaimed,
quite shocked, that this was the opinion of the heretic
Wickliffe, and even La Place 'stopped short in alarm,
at seeing so great a falling off from the religion in
which he had been strictly bred.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_100" id="Ref_100" href="#Foot_100">[100]</a></span>
Calvin was cut to the heart.</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN AT THE LIEUTENANT-GENERAL'S.=</p>

<p>But if he lost some friends, he gained others. The
chief magistrate of Poitiers, Lieutenant-general Pierre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
Regnier de la Planche, desired to see him, and invited
him to dine with De la Dugie, Babinot, Véron, Vernou,
and other acquaintances. Calvin accepted the invitation,
which caused some astonishment. 'This innovator,'
said the catholics, 'desires to court the
magistrates, in order that they may give him importance
by their condescension.' Calvin never made any
such calculations, but he was 'burning with great zeal
to extend the glory of the Lord on every side.' He
was received with respect, and took his seat at the
table; during dinner the conversation turned, it would
seem, on mere common-places. As soon as the meal
was over, the company rose and went into the garden.
It was in this place, known as the <i>Basses Treilles</i>,
that the Sieur de la Planche often received his friends.
That magistrate, Calvin, Babinot, and the other guests
conversed as they walked, and the master of the
house, turning the conversation on Luther and Zwingle,
blamed the reformers, and especially their opinions on
the mass. 'This was a frequent topic of conversation,'
says a writer of the sixteenth century, 'not only
among the learned, but among the common people,
and was even talked of at table.' Calvin, who was
well informed and prepared, entered upon the subject
and explained the chief points. 'Luther saw the
truth,' he said, 'but he is like those who are walking
through a long and winding road; they perceive afar
the dim glimmer of a lamp, by means of which they
can grope their way along the path they must follow.
Zwingle approached the light, but like those who
rush too hastily to good, he went beyond it.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_101" id="Ref_101" href="#Foot_101">[101]</a></span>
Then <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
wishing them to understand what there was in the
Lord's Supper, he stated more in detail the idea of
the presence of Christ, a real one no doubt, but to be
received by faith and not by the mouth: thus taking
a middle position between Zwingle and Luther. These
discourses, being as clear as they were forcible, convinced
the lieutenant-general and the friends he had
assembled. Calvin was requested to commit them to
writing, which he did, adds the historian, with an
eloquence that brought him new disciples. Regnier
de la Planche was gained to protestantism, and his
son Louis subsequently took part in the struggles
against the Guises. It was he whom Catherine de
Medici perfidiously interrogated one day in her closet,
whilst the Cardinal of Lorraine was hidden behind the
tapestry.</p>

<p class="side">=GARDEN OF THE BASSES-TREILLES.=</p>

<p>Henceforth the garden of the Basses-Treilles became
a favourite resort with Calvin: he was accustomed to
go there freely and openly. There, like Socrates in
the garden of Academe, the young christian Plato
and his friends sought for truth.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_102" id="Ref_102" href="#Foot_102">[102]</a></span>
The truth which the Reformation was then restoring to the world, was
of quite a different order, and of far greater power
than that of the Greek philosophers. Wherever its
voice was heard, the idea of a clerical priesthood disappeared,
the prerogatives of monastic life vanished,
and a personal, individual, living Christianity took
their place. The divine revelations were given to laymen
in their mother-tongue, and the sacraments,
stripped of their pretended magical virtues, exercised
a spiritual influence over the heart. Such were the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
principles professed by Calvin in the garden of the
lieutenant-general. As he walked up and down beneath
the pleasant shade, he spoke to his friend of the
heavenly Father, of his only Son, of grace, and of
eternal life. His disciples, as they listened, imagined
that all things were about to become new, and said
to one another that now at last a barren formalism
in the church would give way to a living power—a
breath from heaven. The catholics of Poitiers were
distressed. 'As our first parents,' they said, 'were
enchanted in a garden, so it was in the lieutenant-general's
garden of the Basses-Treilles that this handful
of men were cajoled and duped by Calvin, who
easily made a breach in the souls of those who listened
to him.' This is a remarkable confession.</p>

<p>One day a meeting was held there at which Calvin
and his friends consulted about what France needed
most. The answer was easy: the Gospel. But France,
alas! rejected it. They did not confine themselves
to this topic, and Calvin was anxious to substitute in
the church the spirit for the form, life and reality for
ritual observances. He acquitted himself worthily of
his task, and taking up the principal point explained
specially his spiritual doctrine on the Saviour's presence.
'This,' says the catholic historian, 'was the
first Calvinist council held in France.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_103" id="Ref_103" href="#Foot_103">[103]</a></span>
The word 'council' is too ambitious, but it was a meeting that
bore fruit. The living faith which inspired the young
doctor gained over a few rebellious spirits. De la
Place, who raised numerous objections at first, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
who was a man of common sense and 'good conscience,'
thought that he might possibly be mistaken.
'The seed fallen into his heart began to grow, and it
put forth fruit in the season God had ordained.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_104" id="Ref_104" href="#Foot_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>The agitation which Calvin excited in Poitiers, the
admiration of some, the uneasiness of others, grew
stronger every day. The friends of the Gospel began
to run some risk by meeting together. If certain
fanatics should make themselves masters of the populace,
the garden of the Basses-Treilles might be attacked,
and the police, under colour of restoring order,
might even go so far as to arrest the stranger. There
were often false alarms. Calvin's friends determined
to look for some solitary place where they might
assemble in peace. One of them having pointed out
a <i>wilderness</i> in the adjacent country—a number of
deep and isolated caverns which would shelter them
from all investigations,—they determined to go thither
in little bands, and by different roads.</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN'S GROTTO.=</p>

<p>The next day the project was put in execution.
Calvin set out with two or three others; they traversed
the pretty suburb of St. Benedict, took a
picturesque footpath, and after about an hour's
walking, arrived at a wild-looking spot in front of
the ruins of a Roman aqueduct. Beneath them
flowed the tranquil waters of the Clain: thickly
wooded rocks, containing caverns of various depths,
raised their imposing masses above the stream.
Calvin was charmed with the solitude. Gradually
others arrived, and the assembly was soon complete.
Calvin and his friends entered one of the largest of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
these caves. They were usually known as the caves
of St. Benedict or the Croutelles, but this one was
called, and has ever since borne the name of Calvin's
grotto.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_105" id="Ref_105" href="#Foot_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>The reformer took his stand on the highest ground;
his disciples gathered round him, some of them leaning
against the rock;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_106" id="Ref_106" href="#Foot_106">[106]</a></span>
and in the midst of a solemn
silence he began to teach them, expounding what was
grandest of all—preaching Christ to them. This
was a topic to which he was constantly reverting.
'Better be deprived of everything and possess Christ,'
he said one day. 'If the ship is in danger, the
sailors throw everything overboard, that they may
reach the port in safety. Do likewise. Riches,
honours, rank, outward respect—all should be sacrificed
to possess Christ. He is our only blessedness.'
Calvin spoke with much authority;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_107" id="Ref_107" href="#Foot_107">[107]</a></span>
he carried away his readers, and was himself carried away. On a
sudden feeling his spiritual weakness, and the need
they all had of the Holy Ghost, he fell on his knees
beneath those solitary vaults; all the assembly knelt
with him, and he raised to the throne of God a
prayer so touching and so earnest, that all who heard
him fancied themselves transported to heaven.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_108" id="Ref_108" href="#Foot_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>These pilgrimages to St. Benedict's caves were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
soon observed; ill-disposed persons might follow the
little groups on their way to the meeting, and surprise
the assembly. Calvin's friends resolved to
change their place of meeting frequently, sometimes
going to a village, at others to an isolated country-house.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_109" id="Ref_109" href="#Foot_109">[109]</a></span>
The inhabitants of the neighbourhood would
join the little flock, and the preacher would bring forward
that christian truth which enlightens the world
and man. When they separated, he gave books to
every one, 'and even prayers written with his own
hand.'</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN ON THE MASS.=</p>

<p>Calvin's opposition to the mass gave greater offence
every day; the catholics charged him with the crime
of daring to deny that the priest offered Christ himself
in sacrifice, as an expiatory victim for the sins of
the people. He was moved by these observations,
but not shaken. One day when he and his friends
were assembled in the cavern, he extolled the sacrifice
of the cross offered <i>once</i>, according to Scripture,
and then spoke so forcibly against the mass, that it
was not possible, said earnest catholics, to hear him
without shuddering. It is true that Calvin did not
spare this Romish ceremony. He sometimes called
it a 'mere monkey-trick and burlesque.' 'I call it
a monkey-trick,' he said, 'because they mock the
supper of the Lord, just as a monkey imitates clumsily
whatever he sees others do.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_110" id="Ref_110" href="#Foot_110">[110]</a></span> I
call it a burlesque,
because the nonsense and gestures they
introduce are better adapted to a stage-play than to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
so holy a mystery.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_111" id="Ref_111" href="#Foot_111">[111]</a></span>
There were in the cave some
who believed sincerely in transubstantiation, and who
habitually attended mass with pious sentiments.
Calvin's words—although they may not have been literally
those we have copied—wounded and vexed them,
and Le Sage, abruptly interrupting him, exclaimed:
'Our Lord, very God and very man, is really and
substantially under the appearance of the bread
and the wine.... In all ages, wherever men have
known Christ, the sacrifice of the mass has been
offered up.' Surprised at this bold outbreak, Calvin
asked himself if he had committed a crime in setting
the Word of God above the traditions of Rome.
He kept silence for a few moments, and then lifting
his hand and putting it on the Bible that lay open
before him, he exclaimed earnestly: 'This is my mass!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_112" id="Ref_112" href="#Foot_112">[112]</a></span>
Then uncovering his head and placing his
fur cap on the table, he lifted his eyes to heaven, and
said with emotion: 'O Lord, if in the day of judgment
Thou desirest to punish me because I have
deserted the mass, I will say to Thee: O God, Thou
hast not commanded me to celebrate it. Behold
Thy Law.... Behold Thy Holy Scripture.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_113" id="Ref_113" href="#Foot_113">[113]</a></span>...
Thou didst give it us to be our guide, and I can find no
other sacrifice in it than that which was accomplished
on the altar of the cross.' The hearers separated in
great excitement, touched with the reformer's faith at
once so simple and so strong, and it was with new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span>
convictions that some of them retraced the solitary
paths that conducted them to Poitiers.</p>

<p>From that time many persons manifested a desire
to receive the Supper according to the Lord's institution.
The various ceremonies, the incense, the
choral chants satisfied them no longer; they wished
to have a simple and real communion with the
Saviour. A day was therefore appointed, and they
assembled in one of the caves of St. Benedict.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_114" id="Ref_114" href="#Foot_114">[114]</a></span>
The minister read the Word of God, and called upon the
Lord to pour out His Spirit on the little flock. He
broke the bread and handed round the cup; and then
invited the worshippers to communicate mutually
such reflections and experiences as might be useful
to the faith.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_115" id="Ref_115" href="#Foot_115">[115]</a></span>
These simple exhortations after the
Supper were continued for some time in the reformed
Church.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER VI.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">CALVIN AND HIS DISCIPLES BEGIN THE
 EVANGELISATION OF FRANCE.<br />
 (<span class="smc">Spring 1534.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was necessary to begin the conversion of France
on a larger scale. Might not that country, whose
agitations have often disturbed Europe, and which
never trembles but all around it is shaken—become,
if it received the Gospel, a centre of light and a powerful
means of strengthening the nations in justice and
peace? That would no doubt have happened, had it
become protestant. Calvin, by labouring thirty years
for Geneva and France, laboured for the whole Christian
world. He made the first experiment at Poitiers,
and (if we may use the word) began that glorious
evangelising campaign, which he was to direct until
the close of his life.</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN AND THE ST. GEORGES.=</p>

<p>Not content with evangelising the city, the young
and zealous doctor visited the castles, abbeys, and
villages of the neighbourhood. In the castle of Couhé,
a few leagues south of Poitiers, there lived a patriarchal
family of great influence in Upper Poitou: it
was that of Guichard de St. George, baron of Couhé,
and Anne de Mortemer his wife. At their death they
left four sons, who had early learned to keep God's
commandments. Ponthus, abbot of a Benedictine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>
convent, was the best known of the four brothers:
'He is a liberal and munificent man,' people said, 'a
patron of learning and learned men, whom he welcomes
heartily.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_116" id="Ref_116" href="#Foot_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=EVANGELICAL ABBOTS.=</p>

<p>A rumour of the meetings held at Poitiers reached
Ponthus; being intimate with some of Calvin's disciples
and occasionally receiving them at his table, he
begged them to bring the young doctor, and from
that day Calvin became one of his guests, according
to a tradition preserved in the province.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_117" id="Ref_117" href="#Foot_117">[117]</a></span>
Although the conversations he had with the abbot did not convert
him, they made him take pleasure in the Gospel,
and he soon asked himself why this astonishing young
man should not preach in the Benedictine church?
To address a learned and religious community pleased
the young doctor's mind. The abbot announced to
his monks that a Picard, brought up in the university
of Paris and the holder of a benefice at Noyon, would
preach in the abbey-church. Accordingly Calvin
went into the pulpit and declared that whosoever had a
firm and lively faith in the grace of Christ was saved.
Some of his hearers were startled at a doctrine which
made the Romish priesthood of no use. 'What a perverse
doctrine!' they said; 'why does the abbot allow
this Picard to preach it in his church?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_118" id="Ref_118" href="#Foot_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand the Abbot St. George was delighted
with the young man's sermons, but hesitated
to take the decisive step. The Benedictine abbeys
were independent, powerful, and rich; the monks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span>
generally belonged to noble families, and surpassed the
other religious orders in intelligence, morality, and extensive
familiarity with classical and christian learning.
Ponthus felt a difficulty in leaving the quiet life he led
in his abbey, or in sacrificing his rich benefice, and exposing
himself to the vengeance of the laws.... He
entertained the idea of reconciling the Church with
the world, according to the system patronised by Margaret
of Navarre. He would remain an abbot, but he
would be a christian abbot like Roussel, and although
wearing his friar's dress in the pulpit, he would preach
the Gospel from it. Ponthus made the experiment,
and his sermons caused a great deal of talk. The
astonished hearers exclaimed: 'Why the abbot of
Valence (it was the name of his monastery) is preaching
the rudiments of heresy.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_119" id="Ref_119" href="#Foot_119">[119]</a></span>
Guichard, St. George's
third brother, abbot <i>in commendam</i> of Bonneveau,
erelong shared the convictions of Ponthus, and professed
them like him, but without giving up his benefice.
The murmuring grew louder throughout the district.
'Look,' said the catholics, 'the men who are caught
in Calvin's web still cling to their cloisters and do not
forsake the altars. The abbots stick to their flesh-pot
(<i>marmite</i>), and dress themselves in catholic robes
although they are secret Lutherans. They discharge
their functions without showing what they are.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_120" id="Ref_120" href="#Foot_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Ponthus felt ill at ease, his honest soul did not long
permit him to halt on both sides. He sacrificed a
brilliant position, dismissed his monks, set some to
study and others to learn trades; and then, feeling
convinced as Luther did, that a forced celibacy is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
disorder invented by men, and that marriage is the
order of God, he took a wife. The abbot of Valence
(says an historian) was the first abbot in France who
lifted the mask and showed himself an open Lutheran.
His brothers followed the example he had set them.
The Sieur de l'Orillonière, son of the eldest (the baron
of Couhé) was the first of the family to give his blood
for the protestant cause. Thus did the four brothers,
full of zeal for the Reformation, prepare for themselves
and for their children a life of suffering, combat,
and exile, but also of faith, hope, and peace.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_121" id="Ref_121" href="#Foot_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THREE MISSIONARIES SENT OUT.=</p>

<p>When Calvin saw this movement of life going on
around him, he thought of France. Would she remain
behind Germany and Switzerland?... No. France
will awake ... she is already waking; erelong she
will receive the Gospel in its holy purity, and will increase
in morality, in light, and in liberty: such were
his hopes. But for their realisation, men were needed
who, being regenerate themselves, should be fellow-workers
with God in this new creation. Calvin asked
himself whether some of the converts of Poitiers were
not called to this work? Alas! what a small company
for so large a kingdom! How great the weakness of
the Gospel compared with the magnificence of Rome!
'God acts thus,' he said, 'in order to strip us of all
pride. And therefore he chooses the weak ones of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
this world to confound the strong. If the iron grows
red in the fire,' he added, 'it is that it may be forged.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_122" id="Ref_122" href="#Foot_122">[122]</a></span>
He wished to forge it and to make serviceable instruments
out of it. One day being at the usual meeting,
he said: 'Is there any one here willing to go and give
light to those whom the pope has blinded?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_123" id="Ref_123" href="#Foot_123">[123]</a></span>
Jean Vernou, Philip Véron, and Albert Babinot stood forward.
Calvin had not forgotten the Angoumois
where he possessed beloved friends; thither and into
the adjacent provinces he will first send his missionaries
and commence the evangelisation of France:
'You, Babinot, will go into Guyenne and Languedoc,'
he said; 'Philip Véron, you will go into Saintonge
and Angoumois; and you, Jean Vernou, will stay at
Poitiers and the neighbourhood.' Calvin and the other
brethren did not think that these missionaries required
regular theological studies; had they not received the
necessary gifts from God, 'neither more nor less than
if He had given them with His own hand?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_124" id="Ref_124" href="#Foot_124">[124]</a></span>
But they had need to be recommended to the almighty grace of
God. They therefore prayed together, and Calvin
called upon the Lord to accept the services of these
pious men. He told them to go and proclaim the
Gospel, not in the name of any man, but in the name
of the Lord, and because God commanded it. A collection
provided for the expenses of this mission, and
the evangelists departed.</p>

<p>Babinot having reached the banks of the Garonne
and entered Toulouse, resolved to address in the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
place the young noblemen who were studying there.
A learned man (he had lectured at Poitiers on the
<i>Institutes</i> of Justinian), he was firm, upright, zealous
in the faith, and at the same time very gentle, so that
he was called <i>the Goodfellow</i> (Bonhomme). Many
students were brought to the light by him. He next
began to visit several little flocks in the neighbourhood,
and celebrated the Lord's Supper with them
after the manner which the man of God (as he called
Calvin) had taught him.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_125" id="Ref_125" href="#Foot_125">[125]</a></span>
'He went through the
country, praying secretly here and there in humble
conventicles.' A regent or schoolmaster of Agen,
named Sarrasin, having permitted him to speak in his
school, was himself converted to the Gospel, and immediately
began to teach the Word of God, but not
so as to attract observation.</p>

<p>Véron, who was as remarkable for his activity as
Babinot for his gentleness, carried also into every
place the news of the truth: he spent more than twenty
years in this occupation.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_126" id="Ref_126" href="#Foot_126">[126]</a></span>
He walked on foot through
Poitou, Anjou, Angoumois, Saintonge, and even Guyenne.
'I desire,' he said, 'to gather up the stray
sheep of the Lord.' Wherever he went, he invited
souls to come to the good shepherd, <i>who giveth his life
for the sheep</i>; and those who could distinguish the
voice of the shepherd from that of the wolf, and see
the difference between the call of God and the inventions
of men, answered and entered into the fold.
And hence he was called the Gatherer (<i>ramasseur</i>).
'Of a truth,' said Cayer the priest, 'this Gatherer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
marches out and does not leave a corner of our province,
where he does not go sounding his way, to try
and make some prize.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_127" id="Ref_127" href="#Foot_127">[127]</a></span>
On arriving in any town or
village, he inquired for the best disposed persons,
entered their houses, and sought to instruct them in
the truth. He had taken with him some of Calvin's
manuscripts, and when he desired to strengthen his
hearers' souls, he would take them out of his pocket-book,
and show them, saying that they were the writings
of a great man; and then, after reading a few
extracts, he would return them carefully to their
place. 'The <i>gatherer</i>,' said fervent Roman-catholics,
'shows these papers as a great curiosity, as if they
were Sibylline verses.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_128" id="Ref_128" href="#Foot_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE REFORM AND THE YOUNG.=</p>

<p>These evangelists especially addressed the young.
Calvin would not have religious instruction neglected,
or subordinated to secular instruction: it should have
its separate place. He believed that all culture, but
especially religious teaching, ought to begin with
early youth; that the soul then possesses a power of
receiving and appropriating what is set before it, that
it never will have again; and that if the seeds of a
religious life are not sown and do not germinate in the
heart of the child, the man will perish wholly. He
had said to the three evangelists: 'Let your first
attention be always to the professors and schoolmasters.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_129" id="Ref_129" href="#Foot_129">[129]</a></span>
The zealous catholics observed this method.
'See!' they said, 'as youth is easily led astray,
they hide the <i>minister</i> under the cloak of the <i>magister</i>
(master).'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_130" id="Ref_130" href="#Foot_130">[130]</a></span>
Calvin's friends thus instilled their doctrines
into the schools of Guyenne. Sarrasin converted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span>
another schoolmaster named Vendocin, who became
so firm a Christian, that he preferred to be burnt over
a slow fire to abjuring Calvinism.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_131" id="Ref_131" href="#Foot_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>The men who devoutly adhered to the formulas of
Rome were grieved when they saw the young so
readily receiving the evangelical doctrine. At Bordeaux
and Toulouse, at Angoulême and Aden, in the cloisters,
in the law-courts, and even in the market-places,
the loudest complaints were made. 'These <i>Mercuries</i>
(the name they gave to Calvin's missionaries) are
doing much mischief in the schools,' they said. 'As
soon as the captains of the young (i.e. the masters)
are conquered, the little soldiers march under their
colours. The <i>young</i> heads of <i>young</i> folks are more
easily disturbed by the heretic <i>aconite</i> than the old.
They rush into danger, without examining it; and
they are lost before they are aware of it. They embrace
these new doctrines with such courage that
many, who have only down on their chins, expose
themselves to voluntary death, and thus lose both
soul and body.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_132" id="Ref_132" href="#Foot_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE REFORMATION AND SCIENCE.=</p>

<p>While Babinot and Véron were traversing the
south, John Vernou held firm at Poitiers, and aroused
the students. The Reformation is fond of learning: it
looks upon science as the friend of religion. Faith,
it says, does not require of Christians to know only
what is learnt by faith, or not to know scientifically
what they ought to learn. It desires that we should
know, and know well. But on the other hand, it believes
that true science cannot require of the adept to
despise the truths that faith reveals. It is essential
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span>
to the progress of humanity that there should always
be a good understanding between faith and science.
And accordingly the Reformation calls upon them to
be united. Unhappily, disagreement is possible and
even easy. The philosopher and the christian fall
with great facility into a lamentable onesidedness,
which makes the former despise religion, and the
latter science. In order that faith and science should
seek each other and unite, the moral element should
prevail in those who are engaged with both. If it
is weakened, religion easily produces fanatics, and
science unbelievers: a moral torpor, the sleep of
conscience is in every age the great and only explanation
of these two lamentable errors. As soon as the
conscience is awakened, as soon as that holy light is
kindled in man, there is no longer any fanaticism or
incredulity. Such were Calvin's thoughts. His disciple
Vernou endeavoured like himself to unite faith
with science in the university of Poitiers, and scattered
among the youth who frequented it (as history tells
us) the seeds of Christian doctrine.</p>

<p>Calvin's three missionaries, Babinot, Véron, and
Vernou, were soon famous throughout the west of
France, and the wrath of the clergy of all ranks, and
even of laymen of note, knew no bounds. The college
professors hunted in their Homers for terms of abuse
to heap on these heralds of God's word. 'These three
worthy apostles,' they said, 'are the agents of the
decrees of the arch-heretic Calvin and the firebrands
of France.... Look at them ... these are the men
that want to reform the world.... Wretched Thersites,
miserable Irus, Ithacan beggars ... who set themselves
up as the equals of Ajax and Achilles.... They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span>
were born yesterday, like gourds, and yet they trace
their genealogy, as if they were descended from the
apostles!' Ulysses, as we know, killed the beggar
Irus with a blow of his fist. These disdainful and
bitter critics remembered this, and hoped that the
kings of France would give a death-blow to the Reform.
They dealt the blow, but protestantism was
not slain.</p>

<p>When Calvin was subsequently settled at Geneva,
Babinot, Véron, and Vernou paid him a visit. They
were delighted to find the Christian professor surrounded
with respect, and were never tired of listening
to him from whose lips they had heard at Poitiers the
first words of life. They did not, however, stay with
him. Babinot and Véron returned to the west of
France to continue to propagate the Gospel there,
which they did until their death. As for Vernou, he
was seized while crossing the mountains of Savoy, and
was burnt alive at Chambery, confessing Jesus Christ
his Saviour.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_133" id="Ref_133" href="#Foot_133">[133]</a></span>
Let us return to Poitiers.</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN LEAVES POITIERS.=</p>

<p>The prior of Trois-Moutiers, with whom Calvin
was staying, was one of those who, though fond of
learning and the Gospel, did not wish to break with
the Church. The conversations at the Basses-Treilles,
the 'manducations' in the caves of St. Benedict, the
evangelisation of the city and country ... all made
him uneasy. He was alarmed at the thought that
the officers might knock at his door some day, and
that the <i>heretic</i> would be taken in his house. He
therefore advised Calvin to continue his journey.
The reformer had ended his task; he was now to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
turn his steps elsewhere; he bade his friends farewell.
As he left them, he could say like his Master: <i>What
will I, if the fire be already kindled?</i> Calvin established
the date of the Reformation at Poitiers, when,
writing at a later period to the Church which assembled
in that city, he said: 'Do not go astray
from the doctrine which you have received <i>in part
from us</i>, since it has pleased God to make use of
<i>our labour</i> for your salvation.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_134" id="Ref_134" href="#Foot_134">[134]</a></span>
Although removed,
he still continued to be the director of that Church.
'I know full well that you are <i>spied</i> (guêtés) by the
enemy,' he wrote to them; 'but let not the fear of
persecution hinder you from seeking the pastures of
life.... There is a middle line between temerity and
timidity.... Remain tranquilly (<i>coyement</i>) in your
hiding-place; but beware, my brethren, that you do
not shut the door against those who desire to come to
the kingdom of God.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_135" id="Ref_135" href="#Foot_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>One thought absorbed him at the time he left
Poitiers. It was the month of April 1534; on the
10th of July he would be twenty-five years old. A
regulation of the Church, confirmed by the Council of
Trent, fixed this as the age at which those who have
received the tonsure were promoted to the priesthood.
In early youth he had received the tonsure, that
symbol of sacerdotal royalty, borrowed (St. Jerome
tells us) from the pagan priests of Isis and Serapis;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_136" id="Ref_136" href="#Foot_136">[136]</a></span>
and his age now summoned him to enter holy orders.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
He did not want for friends who advised him to
remain in the Church for its reformation; the chapel
of Gesine at Noyon, and the cure of Pont l'Evêque
awaited him, and many other doors would open before
him. He was invited to come and put himself in
due order. But Calvin shrank in alarm from the
idea of enrolling himself among the pope's soldiers.
'If I make myself the pope's vassal,' he said, 'how
can I conscientiously fight against the papists?...
The sovereign majesty of God would be offended!...
I would sooner give up not only one benefice, but a
hundred, even of the most brilliant.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_137" id="Ref_137" href="#Foot_137">[137]</a></span>
O cursed wealth of the Church! There is not a single penny
of it that is not defiled with cheating, sacrilege, and
robbery!' There was no ecclesiastical dignity to
which a mind so preeminently administrative might
not aspire. But Calvin was convinced that to save
the Church it was necessary to sacrifice Rome. Two
paths lay before him: one broad and easy, the other
narrow and difficult: his choice was not doubtful.
'The Gospel,' he said, 'is more than all the riches,
honour, and ease of this world.... I am ready to give
up everything that withdraws me from it.'</p>

<p>Calvin left Poitiers, accompanied by his faithful Du
Tillet, who for two years scarcely ever quitted him.
The young canon was one of those honest but weak
natures who have absolute need of a support, and
who not knowing how to find it in the word of God,
seek it in strong men. He therefore attached himself
to the young reformer, as the vine to the elm. Alas!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
the day was to come, when terrified by persecution,
and unable to make up his mind to break with the
Church, he would cling to the papacy and take that
for his support.</p>

<p class="side">=IMPRESSION HE LEFT AT POITIERS.=</p>

<p>A surprising transformation had been effected in
Poitiers, and Calvin left behind him many regrets
and tears. 'Oh! would to God that we had many
Calvins!' wrote Charles de Ste. Marthe, one of the
professors of the university. 'I am distressed that
you have been taken from us; I envy the country
where you are, and my only consolation is that our
university is now filled with pious and learned men.
Pray to God that, by the Spirit of Christ, we may
worthily proclaim the Gospel, in the midst of our
enemies and even in the midst of the flames.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_138" id="Ref_138" href="#Foot_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Calvin passed through Orleans, went on to Paris,
and then proceeded to Noyon, where he arrived at the
beginning of May. He immediately informed his
relations and the bishop that he had come to resign
his benefices. We may imagine the astonishment
of his friends. What! let slip the opportunity of
doing so much good in the Church! Renounce important
offices to join an obscure sect! It seemed
the act of a madman; but nothing could bend his
unshakeable resolution.</p>

<p>On Monday, May 4, 1534, in the presence of the
grand vicar of Monseigneur the bishop and count
of Noyon, of his chancellor, and of the notary of the
chapter, Calvin resigned the chapel of Gesine in
favour of Master Anthony de la Marlière, and his cure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
in favour of another ecclesiastic of Noyon. It would
even appear that he sold his patrimonial property at
the same time.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_139" id="Ref_139" href="#Foot_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Having broken the last ties that bound him to the
Roman Church, Calvin began to speak with greater
freedom to those around him of the Gospel.</p>

<p>He had found in his father's house two brothers and
a sister, Anthony, Charles, and Mary: these were the
first persons he invited to Christ, in affectionate and
pious conversations. He then turned to some members
of the episcopal clergy and other inhabitants of
Noyon. He put his hand (to use his own expression)
on those who were running elsewhere, 'to stop them
short.' Anthony and Mary were the first to answer
to him. Charles resisted longer; he received however
at that time a seed in his heart which germinated
afterwards.</p>

<p>A canon, named Henry de Collemont, some other
clergymen, and a few of the citizens, appear to have
lent an ear to the pious and eloquent words of their
young fellow-citizen. However, he was anxious to
return to the capital, and about the end of May he
was in Paris, where fresh struggles awaited him.</p>

Marsay, with Voltaire, in his château of Changins, near Geneva, is well
known. Appointed British resident in that city in 1717, he acquired the
rights of citizenship (<i>France Protestante</i>, under <i>Saint

George, for many years president of the Evangelical Society of Geneva,

</div>

<p class="side">=PROGRESS OF THE GOSPEL IN FRANCE.=</p>

<p class="drop-cap">CALVIN found Paris very different from what he
had left it, when he had quitted it in such great
haste eight months before. The times seemed favourable
to the Gospel. The King of England, although
remaining catholic at heart, had resolved to emancipate
himself from the dominion of Rome: this event
had created a great sensation throughout Europe, and
men asked whether Francis I. would not imitate 'his
good brother.' He did not seem far from it. At
that time he was uniting with the protestant princes
of Germany, he was restoring one of them to his
states, and laying before the French clergy articles
of faith drawn up by the author of the <i>Confession of
Augsburg</i>. Calvin knew of these strange acts of the
monarch, and it was partly this which had induced
him to return to Paris. Francis I. was not the only
person in France who felt new aspirations. There
was in all classes a leaning towards a reformation.
The learned called for liberty of thought, and desired
to see the reign of the monks come to an end. Certain
statesmen wished to deliver France from the
enslaving influence of Rome, even while maintaining
its catholicity. William du Bellay, the king's most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
active minister, called Bucer the reformer, 'an excellent
professor of the best theology;'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_140" id="Ref_140" href="#Foot_140">[140]</a></span>
and wrote to
him: 'Everything bids us be hopeful: the king's
taste for a better learning (that is, for the Holy Scriptures)
increases day by day.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_141" id="Ref_141" href="#Foot_141">[141]</a></span>
Bucer himself, who
was full of hope, communicated it to his friends:
'The pope's reign is falling very low in France,' he
wrote, 'and many people long for Jesus Christ.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_142" id="Ref_142" href="#Foot_142">[142]</a></span>
The clergy became uneasy, and a Franciscan friar
complained that 'the heresy of Luther having entered
France, had already covered so much ground, as
almost to call itself her mistress, even in Paris.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_143" id="Ref_143" href="#Foot_143">[143]</a></span>
Noblemen and men of letters, citizens, students, and
many of the lower classes hailed the Reformation as
the commencement of a new day. 'All who have
any sense,' it was said, 'whatever be their age or sex,
when they hear the truth preached, forsake bigotry.'</p>

<p>Such were the circumstances under which Calvin
came to reside in Paris at the house of his friend La
Forge, at the sign of the <i>Pelican</i>, in the Rue St.
Martin. The pious tradesman and his wife received
him with the most cordial hospitality, and fearing lest
he should again expose a life so precious to the
Church, they conjured him not to trust too much to
what was said about the king's disposition, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">{81}</a></span>
beware of teaching in public, if he would not risk his life.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_144" id="Ref_144" href="#Foot_144">[144]</a></span>
The flame of persecution which appeared
extinct, might break out again at any moment.</p>

<p class="side">=MARTYRDOM OF POINTET.=</p>

<p>One martyrdom, of which he was told all the particulars,
was well calculated to enforce these rules
of prudence. Calvin did not find in Paris that
strong and decided christian, Pointet the surgeon,
whom he had often seen at the meetings.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_145" id="Ref_145" href="#Foot_145">[145]</a></span>
The monks, whom this bold man had reprimanded so
soundly for their immoralities, had raised a clamour
against him; Leclerc, the priest of St. André-des-Arts,
had prosecuted him; he had been imprisoned in
the Conciergerie and condemned to be burnt after
being strangled. This was paying very dearly for
the lessons of morality he had given the friars.
Before the hour of execution, the gaoler had taken
him into the prison chapel, and left him there with a
monk before an image. The confessor began to
exhort him: 'Kneel down before that image and ask
pardon for your sins.' Seeing that his penitent
remained motionless, he seized him by the neck to
force him upon his knees. But Pointet, who was
naturally of a 'violent temper,' thrust the monk back
roughly, saying: 'Satan, begone, and do not tempt
me to turn idolater.' The confused and exasperated
confessor ran hastily out of the chapel, and going to
the criminal chamber told the president and his two
assessors what had passed, and begged them to come
and bring the man to reason. 'He is a madman, he
is out of his senses,' exclaimed the magistrates,
as they accompanied the confessor. These three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
individuals, who had just condemned Pointet to be
strangled, having repeated the invitation which the
monk had given him, the prisoner, who was annoyed
by this persecution, treated them as he had treated the
monk; he called them 'bloodthirsty wretches, murderers,
robbers, who unjustly and against all reason
put to death the children of God!' The three judges,
excited and terrified in their turn, hurried back to
the court, and there, heated by passion, they increased
the severity of the sentence, adding that Pointet
should have his tongue cut out before anything else
was done to him. Had not that tongue called them
murderers? It was hoped that he would now show
himself more tractable, but they were mistaken. The
steadfast christian could not speak, but he refused to
make the least sign of recantation, and to bend his
head before an image. The enemies of truth (as the
chronicle styles them) seeing this, had recourse to a
fresh aggravation of the sentence: they condemned
him to be burnt alive, 'which was done as cruelly as
they could devise.' This death produced a deep impression
on the minds of the evangelical christians of
Paris.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_146" id="Ref_146" href="#Foot_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Calvin, yielding to the representations of his friends,
resolved to substitute 'private admonitions' for
preaching at the assemblies, and began by visiting
the humble christians whom he had heard spoken of
at La Forge's.</p>

<p class="side">=THE PARALYTIC.=</p>

<p>In the street which lay between the two gates of
the law courts, there was a shoemaker's shop. On
entering it, no one was seen but a poor hunchback,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span>
crippled in all his limbs, except the tongue and the
arms. This paralytic creature was the shoemaker's
son, and by name Bartholomew. 'Alas!' said his
father, Robert Milon, to those who expressed their
compassion at the sight, 'he was not always so; he
was quite another person in his youth, endowed with
excellent gifts both of body and mind.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_147" id="Ref_147" href="#Foot_147">[147]</a></span>
In fact, Bartholomew was once the handsomest man of the
parish, very clever, and full of liveliness and imagination.
He had abused these gifts; he had followed
his impassioned disposition, and had launched into
life, indulging in all the lusts of youth, in foolish
amours and other kinds of irregularities with which
young folks willingly defile themselves. Continually
carried away by his impetuous temper, he equally
courted pleasures and quarrels, he rushed into the
midst of the strife as soon as any discussion arose,
and displayed unparalleled temerity in all his disputes.
He got up balls and concerts, despised the things of
God, turned the priests into ridicule, and laughed at
pious men. Everybody in the quarter talked about
Berthelot (as he was called) and of his exploits;
some with admiration, others with fear. All the
young men looked up to him as their leader.</p>

<p class="side">=MILON'S CONVERSION.=</p>

<p>One day, while giddily indulging in his ordinary
diversions, he met with a fall and broke his ribs.
As he would not apply any remedy, the mischief
grew worse; the various parts of his body 'died
little by little,' and he was entirely paralysed.
What a change in his life! Poor Bartholomew, who
had been so proud of his beauty, now weak, brokendown,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span>
deprived of the use of his limbs, unable any
more to associate with his friends, was obliged to keep
in his father's shop all day long. He was deeply distressed,
not only by the severe pains he suffered, but
more by the sight of his deformity. Sitting near the
window, he had no other amusement than to watch
the passers-by, and his temper being still the same,
or rather soured by his misfortunes, he was not
sparing of his sarcasms. One day, seeing one of the
evangelicals passing before the shop, he began to
insult him, and 'to scoff at the terrible majesty of
God.'—'Holloa! Lutheran!' he called out, adding
all sorts of taunts. The christian stopped; he was
touched when he saw the pitiful condition of the
wretched individual who insulted him, and going up
to him, said affectionately: 'Poor man, why do you
mock at the passers-by? Do you not see that God
has <i>bent your body in this way in order to straighten
your soul</i>?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_148" id="Ref_148" href="#Foot_148">[148]</a></span>
These simple words struck Milon: he
had never thought that his <i>soul</i> was <i>bent</i> as well as
his body. 'Can it be true,' he asked, 'that God has
made these misfortunes fall upon me, in order to reform
his misguided creature?' He lent an ear to
the Lutheran, who spoke with him, and gave him a
New Testament, saying: 'Look at this book, and a
few days hence you will tell me what you think of
it.' Milon took the Gospel, opened it, and having
begun, says the chronicler, 'to taste the fruit of this
reading, he continued at it night and day.' This
little volume was enough for him: he had no need of
any teacher. The sword of the Word of God pierced
to the bottom of his heart, and his past life terrified
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span>
him. But the gospel consoled him: 'It was to him
like a loud trumpet sounding the praise of the grace
of Christ.' Milon found the Saviour: 'Mercy has been
shown me,' he said, 'in order that the love of God
which pardons the greatest sinners, should be placed
as on a hill, and be seen by all the world.' He had
now a curb that restrained him, and prevented him
from 'indulging in abuse, quarrels, bickerings, squabbles
and contentions.' The wolf had become a lamb.
Bartholomew imparted the riches he had found in the
book of God to his father, to the other members of his
family, and to all the customers who visited the shoemaker's
shop. There was not a room in Paris that
offered a spectacle at once so interesting and so varied.</p>

<p>Bartholomew's christian charity became as inexhaustible
as his worldly skill had once been fertile
in inventing amusements. He devoted entirely to
God the restless activity which he had lavished on
the world. At certain hours of the day, the poor
young man, 'unequalled in the art of writing,' would
collect the children of the neighbourhood round his
bed and dictate to them a few words of the Bible,
teaching them how to form their letters properly.
At other times he thought of the necessities of the
poor, and laboured diligently with his own hands:
'etching with aquafortis on knives, daggers, and
sword-blades,' he executed many unusual things for
the goldsmiths. He spent the proceeds of his labour
in supporting several needy persons who possessed
a knowledge of the Gospel. He had also a fine voice,
and played on several instruments 'with singular
grace;' accordingly, every morning and evening he
consecrated to the praise of the Lord those gifts which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
he had formerly dedicated to pleasure, accompanying
himself as he sang psalms and spiritual songs. People
came from all quarters to this shop, which was situated
in the centre of Paris: some came 'by reason
of the excellent and rare things he did;' others
'visited him to hear his singing.' A large number
were attracted by the great and sudden change that
had taken place in him. 'If God has bestowed these
gifts on me,' said the poor paralytic, 'it is to the end
that His glory should be magnified in me.' He
meekly taught the humble to receive the Gospel, and
if any hypocrites presented themselves, 'he took
them aside, and launched on them the thunderbolts
of God.' 'In short,' adds the chronicler, 'his room
was a true school of piety, day and night, re-echoing
with the glory of the Lord.'</p>

<p class="side">=DU BOURG AND VALETON.=</p>

<p>At some distance from this spot, but near De la
Forge's, at the entrance of the Rue St. Denis, at the
corner of the boulevard, was a large draper's shop, the
<i>Black Horse</i>, belonging to John du Bourg. This
tradesman was a man of independent character, who
liked to see, to understand, and to judge for himself:
he had never frequented the schools or even had
much conversation with the evangelicals, but for all
that, says the chronicle, he had not been denied the
wisdom from heaven. By means of the Holy Scriptures,
which he read constantly, and in which he
humbly sought the truth, he had received from God
the knowledge of those 'glad tidings which (as it was
said) the wise cannot obtain by their own wisdom.'
Forthwith he had begun to spread it around him with
an unwearying activity, which astonished his neighbours.
'That ardour, which makes a great show at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
the beginning,' said some of his relatives, 'will soon
end in smoke, like a fire of tow as the proverb says.'
They were mistaken; the Word had sunk into his
heart, and taken such deep root there, that it could
not be plucked out. The priests had intrigued, kinsfolk
had clamoured, and customers had deserted him,
but 'neither money nor kindred could ever turn him
aside from the truth.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_149" id="Ref_149" href="#Foot_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>While his old friends were growing distant, new
ones were drawing near him. A receiver of Nantes,
Peter Valeton by name, was often seen entering his
shop. Like Du Bourg, he was 'a man of sense and
credit,' but while the tradesman had been instructed
in solitude by the Holy Ghost, the receiver had come
to a knowledge of the Gospel 'by means of some good
people with whom he associated,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_150" id="Ref_150" href="#Foot_150">[150]</a></span>
and then the study
of the New Testament had confirmed his faith. He
did not stop here. Being in easy circumstances, and
fond of books, he bought all the writings of the
reformers he could procure. If there was one in any
bookseller's back shop, he would catch it up, pay for
it instantly, hide it under his cloak, for fear the
volume should be seen, and hurry home with it. On
reaching his room, he would place it at the bottom of
a large chest or trunk, the key of which he always
carried with him. Then as soon as he had a spare
moment, he would close his door, reopen the chest,
take out the precious book, and read it eagerly. He
listened if any person was coming, for though he was
a faithful soul, he was still weak in the faith, and was
afraid of the stake.</p>

<p>All these pious men joyfully welcomed those who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
showed any love for the Gospel. There was sometimes
present at their meetings a Picard gentleman,
by name John le Comte, belonging to the household
of the Amirale de Bonnivet, widow of the celebrated
favourite of Francis I. He was born at
Etaples in 1500, had attached himself to Lefèvre, his
fellow-townsman, followed him into Briçonnet's service,
and only left him to enter Madame de Bonnivet's
family, as tutor to her three sons. Constantly attending
the meetings of the little Church, he often spoke
at them, and every one appreciated his knowledge of
Scripture (he could read them in Hebrew), his sound
theology, and his talent in expounding the truth.
We shall meet with him again in Switzerland.</p>

<p class="side">=GIULIO CAMILLO.=</p>

<p>Another rather singular person attracted the attention
of the assembly by his dark complexion, his
gloomy look, and mysterious air. He was a celebrated
Italian, Giulio Camillo of Forli (in the States
of the Church), philosopher, orator, poet, astrologer,
philologist,and mythologist, of great skill in the cabalistic science,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_151" id="Ref_151" href="#Foot_151">[151]</a></span>
who pretended to hold intercourse with
the elementary beings, and had laboured forty years in
constructing a machine in the form of a theatre, full
of little niches, in which he lodged all our faculties
and many other things besides, and by means of
which he pretended to teach all the sciences. Francis I.
having invited him to Paris, Camillo exhibited to
him, and explained, his wonderful machine, at which
the king was delighted, and gave him 500 ducats.
Although taciturn and dreamy, he courted the society
of pious men. Paleario speaks of him in his letters,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_152" id="Ref_152" href="#Foot_152">[152]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span>
and he became intimate in Paris with Sturm, who
willingly received into his house the learned of all
countries. The latter was charmed to see a scholar,
invited from Italy by the king, and of whom all the
world was talking, inclining towards the Gospel; and
one day, writing to Bucer, he said: 'Camillo professes
not only profound science but admirable piety also....
God often does something by means of men of
this sort; who, when their will is equal to their
means, become great patterns.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_153" id="Ref_153" href="#Foot_153">[153]</a></span>
Camillo knocked at
the door and came in while Sturm was writing.
Sturm showed him the letter, and the Italian wrote
at the foot: 'Would to God that my mind were in my
hands, or that it could flow from my pen!... If you
could see it you would certainly recognise it as your own.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_154" id="Ref_154" href="#Foot_154">[154]</a></span>
It would appear that Camillo was deceived.
He was a man of original mind, desirous of learning
everything new, including the Reformation; but there
was some quackery in him. If his famous machine
did nothing for the progress of science, it advanced
his fortunes, which was a compensation in his eyes.
Calvin was less pleased with him than Sturm; the
eagle eye of the reformer was not deceived. The
Italian's gloomy air seemed to hide some unbelief or
heresy. 'If spiritual joy reign not in our hearts,' he
said, 'the kingdom of God is not in us.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_155" id="Ref_155" href="#Foot_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Many other well-known persons visited the friends
of the Gospel in Paris; among them were Des
Fosset, afterwards lieutenant-general of Berry, Jacques
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
Canaye, subsequently a famous advocate before the
parliament, besides other lawyers, noblemen, royal
servants, tradesmen, and professors. Persecution made
them known, and we shall have to name many of them
among the exiles and martyrs.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_156" id="Ref_156" href="#Foot_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides these adult laymen, a number of scholars
or students was observed at the evangelical meetings.
Among them was a boy of Melun, Jacques
Amyot by name, 'of very low origin,' says Beza,
picked up in the streets of Paris by a lady, who,
wishing to turn him to account, made him attend her
sons to college and carry their books. Amyot, who
was to be one of the most celebrated writers of the
age, soon showed a wonderful aptitude for Greek
literature; he had even learnt to know something of
the Gospel. He was to change hereafter, to take orders,
to forget what he had learnt, and even to become
'a very wretched persecutor;'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_157" id="Ref_157" href="#Foot_157">[157]</a></span>
but at this time he
was considered to be a friend of the new doctrine.</p>

<p>It was the common people, however, that were
most numerous at these conventicles. One of them,
Henry Poille, a poor bricklayer from a village near
Meaux, told a friend one day 'that he had come to a
knowledge of the truth in the school of Meaux, thanks
to Bishop Briçonnet. Alas!' he added, 'the bishop has
been overcome since then by the enemies of the cross.'</p>

<p>Even the most necessitous persons were active in
good works. A poor woman named Catelle had
turned school-mistress out of love for children. 'It
would be too cruel a thing,' she said, 'to exclude
those of tender age from God's grace!'</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></div>

<p>But of all these evangelical christians of Paris no
one had more zeal than De la Forge. 'He never
spared his goods for the poor,' says the chronicler.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_158" id="Ref_158" href="#Foot_158">[158]</a></span>
He had the Bible printed at his own expense, and
along with the alms which he distributed he would
always add a kind word, and often a Gospel or some
other pious book.</p>

<p class="side">=A CHARACTERISTIC OF CALVIN.=</p>

<p>Calvin was not however equally pleased with everything
in Paris. He willingly recognised the beauty
of the city, but was terrified at seeing fearful abysses
and (as he called them) 'the depths of hell' side by side
with its magnificent palaces. He felt 'extreme sadness'
at the sight. An immense movement was then
being accomplished all over the world. As the sun
of spring brings up the seed sown in the earth—the
tares as well as the good seed—the sun of liberty
that was beginning to shine quickened not only the
germs of truth, but sometimes also those of error.
Calvin's soul was deeply grieved at this; but he did
not stand still. He had received from God the call to
oppose all false doctrines, and was preparing to do so.
This is one of the main features of his character. To
the very last he combated the pride of those who wish
to know everything; the rage for subtleties, mystical
pretensions, immorality, unitarian doctrines, the
deism which denies the supernatural, and the pantheistic
and atheistic theories. In Paris he met with all
these aberrations. His principal means of combating
error was to put forward the truth; yet he thought it
useful sometimes to have conversations and even conferences
with his adversaries, of which we shall see
some examples.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">CALVIN'S FIRST RELATIONS WITH THE LIBERTINES
 AND SERVETUS.<br />
 (<span class="smc">Summer 1534.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DE LA FORGE willingly received all pious strangers
visiting Paris. One day Calvin saw at
his friend's table certain individuals who, he fancied,
had something singular about them. His eyes were
fixed on them and he tried to make them out. One of
them, named Coppin, from Lille, a man of the people
and of no education, but with boldness greater than
his ignorance, raised his voice, affected a sententious
style, and spoke like an oracle. 'Verily,' said Calvin,
'a fool never has any doubts.' A little farther on sat
Quintin from Hainault, who seemed to have more
education, and certainly more cunning. He assumed
airs of superiority, an imposing tone of voice, and
expressing himself ambiguously, gave himself the air
of a prophet. 'The latter seems to me a big rogue,'
said Calvin of him.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_159" id="Ref_159" href="#Foot_159">[159]</a></span>
Quintin was usually accompanied
by a few disciples, ignorant and fanatical persons
who repeated all he said; they were Bertrand des
Moulins, Claude Perceval, and others. These bold
and adventurous sectarians having nothing and never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span>
working, looked out wherever they went for some
good-natured person who would keep them in their
idleness by supplying them with victuals and drink.
They crept into the house by meek enticing ways,
making no display at first of their particular doctrines,
reserving these for the initiated only. They
strove to win over all who listened to them, and to
that end spoke continually of the Holy Ghost, and
tried to make men believe that they were His apostles.
Simple souls allowed themselves to be caught. They
would have believed they had committed the unpardonable
sin, if they had not looked upon these people
as saints.</p>

<p class="side">=THE SPIRITUALS OR LIBERTINES.=</p>

<p>One day when there was a large party at De la
Forge's, Quintin began to publish his doctrines.
Whatever was the subject of conversation, the <i>spirit</i>
immediately appeared. Calvin lost all patience: 'You
are like those country priests,' he said, 'who, having
but one image in their church, make it serve for five
or six saints. He is either St. James, or St. Francis,
or St. Basil, and the priest receives as many offerings
as there are saints.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_160" id="Ref_160" href="#Foot_160">[160]</a></span>
Sometimes, however, these
'spirituals,' as they were called, betrayed themselves,
and let their fanatical opinions slip out.
'There are not many spirits,' said Quintin, 'there is
only one spirit of God, who is and lives in all creatures.
It is this sole spirit which does everything;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_161" id="Ref_161" href="#Foot_161">[161]</a></span>
man has no will, no more than if he were a stone.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_162" id="Ref_162" href="#Foot_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Such language surprised Calvin. He examined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
the strange prophets, and discovered several capital
errors in them. 'The Holy Spirit is our reason,' said
some, 'and that Spirit teaches us that there is neither
condemnation nor hell.'—'The soul,' said others,
'is material and mortal.'—'God is everything,' said
Quintin, 'and everything is God.' Immoral doctrines
were combined with this system. Calvin's conscience
was terrified: he had risen up for the purpose of
destroying a worm-eaten framework that men had
built round the temple of God, and now rash hands
were presuming to destroy the temple itself. He
wished to destroy the superstitious traditions of so
many ages, only to set the Divine truths of the apostolic
times in their place; and all of a sudden he
found himself face to face with men who desired no
other God but nature, and would change the world
into a vast wilderness. Calvin did not separate from
Rome in order to be less christian, but to be more
so. He resolved, therefore, to attack those who under
the cloak of Protestantism suppress the mysteries of
faith; to combat with the same severity both pope
and sectarians, and if he undertook to destroy the
fables of men, he would try still more to preserve the
revelations of God. Had not Luther cried out when
speaking of these would-be spirituals: 'It is the devil
who seeks to turn you aside from the truth....
Turn your backs upon the drivellers!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_163" id="Ref_163" href="#Foot_163">[163]</a></span>
Various circumstances which were then taking place under
Calvin's eyes, made him understand more clearly the
necessity of opposing these threatening doctrines with
the utmost energy.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></div>

<p class="side">=A MURDER AND A THEFT.=</p>

<p>One day a man had been murdered in the streets
of Paris; a great crowd had gathered round his body,
and a pious Christian exclaimed: 'Alas! who has
committed this crime?' Quintin, who was there also,
made answer immediately, in his Picard <i>patois</i>:
'Since you want to know, it was <i>me</i>!' The other
said to him with surprise: 'What! could you be such
a coward?' 'It was not me, it was God.' 'What!' exclaimed
the man, 'you impute to God a crime which
He punishes?' Then the wretched man, 'discharging
his poison more copiously,' continued: 'Yes, it's
thee, it's me, it's God; for what thee or me does, it
is God who does it; and what God does, we do.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_164" id="Ref_164" href="#Foot_164">[164]</a></span>
Another analogous circumstance occurred in the house
of Calvin's friend. De la Forge had a servant to
whom he paid high wages; this man robbed his
master, and ran away with the money. A shoemaker
of the neighbourhood, who held Quintin's opinions,
having gone to the shop the same day, found the
tradesman very uneasy: 'The man who has committed
such a base action,' he said, 'might easily take
advantage of my credit, and borrow in my name.'
Whereupon, as Calvin relates, the shoemaker immediately
began to flap his wings, and was up into the
clouds, exclaiming: 'It is blaspheming God to call
this action base; ... seeing that God does everything,
we ought to reckon nothing bad.' Some days
later, this philosopher was himself robbed by a servant.
Immediately forgetting all his spiritual knowledge, he
rushed out of the house 'like a madman,' to search
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span>
after the thief, and on reaching De la Forge's, was
lavish of his abuse against the culprit. De la Forge
ironically repeated to him his own words: 'But you
accuse God,' he said, 'since it is He who did it.' The
shoemaker sneaked of abashed, 'like a dog with his
tail between his legs.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_165" id="Ref_165" href="#Foot_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=FALSE LIBERTY OF THE SPIRITUALS.=</p>

<p>Calvin began the contest. It was not with philosophy,
or speculation, or apologetics, that he fought
these pretended spiritualists. 'God,' said he, 'enlightens
us sufficiently in Scripture; it is our want
of knowing them thoroughly that is the cause and
source of all errors.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_166" id="Ref_166" href="#Foot_166">[166]</a></span>
He attacked Quintin and pressed him hard. He quoted the commandments of
God against theft and murder: 'You call God impure,'
he said, 'a thief and a robber,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_167" id="Ref_167" href="#Foot_167">[167]</a></span>
and you add that there is no harm in it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_168" id="Ref_168" href="#Foot_168">[168]</a></span>
Who, I pray, has condemned
impurity, theft, murder, if God has not?'...
Quintin, who was generally very liberal with passages
from Scripture, answered with a smile: 'We are not
subject to the letter which killeth, but to the Spirit
which giveth life.... The Bible contains allegories,
myths which the Holy Spirit explains to us.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_169" id="Ref_169" href="#Foot_169">[169]</a></span>
'You make your Scripture a nose of wax,' said Calvin, 'and
play with it, as if it were a ball.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_170" id="Ref_170" href="#Foot_170">[170]</a></span>—'You
find fault with my language because you do not understand it,'
said Quintin.—'I understand it a little better than you
do yourself,' retorted Calvin; 'and I see pretty plainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span>
that you desire to mislead (<i>embabouiner</i>) the world
by absurd and dangerous trifling.'</p>

<p>The 'spirituals' were by turns protestant or catholic
as suited them. Their manner of seeing accorded
very well with their pantheism, and they would have
been quite as much at their ease among the Hindoos
and the Turks. This broadness, which misled the
moderate party, offended Calvin. One day, when
Quintin said with unction: 'I am just come from a
solemn mass, celebrated by a cardinal.... I have seen
the glory of God,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_171" id="Ref_171" href="#Foot_171">[171]</a></span>—'I
understand you,' said Calvin,
rather coarsely; 'in your opinion, a canon ought to
continue in his luxury, and a monk in his convent,
like a pig in a sty.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_172" id="Ref_172" href="#Foot_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>The pantheists made proselytes. 'By dint of
intrigue and flattery, they attracted the simple ignorant
poor, whom they made as lazy as themselves.'
They tried to make way with the learned and the
great, and even to creep into the hearts of princes.
Their high pretensions to spirituality staggered weak
minds, and the convenient principle by which every
man ought to remain in the Church to which he
belonged, even were it sunk in error, made timid and
irresolute characters lean to their side. A priest, who
had become Quintin's head champion, succeeded in
deceiving the excellent Bucer by means of the false
appearance he put on; and ten years later, an elect
soul, Margaret, was dazzled and deceived by their hypocritical
spirituality. About 4,000 were led astray
in France.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></div>

<p>Calvin was not one of those individuals 'who remain
in doubt and suspense;' from the very first he
detected pantheism and materialism under the veils
with which these men sought from time to time to conceal
their errors, and boldly pointed them out. His
uprightness and frankness presented a very striking
contrast to their dissimulation and cunning. 'They
turn their cloak inside out at every moment,' he said,
'so that you do not know where to hold them. One
of the principal articles of their creed is that men
ought to counterfeit, whilst even the heathens have
said "that it is better to be a lion than a fox."'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_173" id="Ref_173" href="#Foot_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>He found that their doctrines were impious and
revolutionary. To confound God with the world
was (he thought) to take from the world the living
personal God who is present in the midst of us; and
consequently to expose not only the Reformation and
Christianity but the whole social system to utter
ruin. The conduct of these pretended 'spirituals'
was already sufficient in his eyes to characterise and
condemn their system. 'What has metamorphosed
Quintin and his companions from tailors into teachers,'
said Calvin, 'is that, preferring to be well fed
and at their ease to working, they find it convenient
to gain their living by prating, as priests and
monks do by chanting.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_174" id="Ref_174" href="#Foot_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not until later that Calvin wrote his excellent
treatise against the libertines;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_175" id="Ref_175" href="#Foot_175">[175]</a></span>
but, says Theodore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
Beza, 'it was then (during his stay in Paris)
that he first encountered those teachers who revived
in our times the detestable sect of the Carpocratians,
abolishing all difference between good and
evil.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_176" id="Ref_176" href="#Foot_176">[176]</a></span>
He encountered a probably still more dangerous
doctrine.</p>

<p class="side">=SERVETUS.=</p>

<p>About that time a stranger, whose proceedings were
rather mysterious, used to appear at rare intervals in
the little circles of Paris. Many persons spoke highly
of him. They said, he could not be reproached with
any immoral tendencies, while his subtle understanding,
his brilliant genius, his profound knowledge of
natural science, and his fiery imagination, seemed as
if they would make him one of the most surprising
and influential leaders of the epoch. This was Michael
Servetus, a man of the same age as Calvin. Born at
Villenueva in Arragon, he had studied the law at
Toulouse, and afterwards published a daring work
entitled, <i>On the Errors of the Trinity</i>. He put himself
forward as a teacher of truth and a thorough
reformer. The great mysteries of faith were to give
way to a certain pantheism, enveloped in mystical and
Sabellian forms. It was not Roman-catholicism alone
which he desired to reform, but the evangelical
reformation also, substituting for its scriptural and
practical character a philosophic and rationalistic
tendency.</p>

<p>In order to accomplish this transformation of protestantism,
Servetus began by associating with the
reformers of German Switzerland and of Germany.
Œcolampadius, having examined him, declared that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
he could not count him a christian unless he acknowledged
the Son as partaking through all eternity of
the real Godhead of the Father. Melanchthon was
alarmed at hearing his doctrines: 'His imagination is
confused,' he said; 'his ideas are obscure. He possesses
many marks of a fanatical spirit.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_177" id="Ref_177" href="#Foot_177">[177]</a></span>
He raves on the subjects of Justification and the Trinity....
O God! what tragedies this question will occasion
among our posterity!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_178" id="Ref_178" href="#Foot_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>We may easily understand the painful impression
Servetus made on these two men, the most tolerant of
the sixteenth century. He was, as we have said, a
mystic rationalist; but rationalism and protestantism,
which many persons confound together, are two opposite
poles. Nothing excited the indignation of the
reformers more than this pride of human reason which
pretends unaided to explain God, and to accomplish
without his help the moral renovation of man. The
Spanish doctor, finding himself thus rejected by the
German divines, quitted those parts sore vexed and
exclaiming: 'May the Lord confound all the tyrants
of the Church! Amen.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_179" id="Ref_179" href="#Foot_179">[179]</a></span>
He went to Paris under
the name of Michael de Villeneuve.</p>

<p>Servetus had an object in going to France. If he
succeeded in planting his standard in that mighty
country, near that university which had been for so
many ages the queen of intelligence, his triumph (he
thought) would be secure. He willingly left Germany
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
to the Germans. That French nation which has the
prerogative of universality, which succeeds in everything,
which is so intelligent, so frank, so communicative,
so practical and so active—he will select to
be the organ of the second Reformation. Servetus
thought the French reformers more daring than those
of Saxony. He had heard of a young doctor of great
ability, who desired to carry the reform farther than
Luther, and he thought he had found his man. But
he was mistaken; that man was far above his empty
theories.</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN AND SERVETUS ON THE TRINITY.=</p>

<p>Calvin could not and would not have any other
God than Him who gives us life, who has ransomed us,
and who sanctifies us—the Father, God above us;
the Son, God for us; the Holy Ghost, God in us.
This threefold relation with God, which Scripture revealed
to him and which entirely satisfied his inward
longings, forced him to recognise a <i>difference</i> in God;
but on the other hand, <i>unity</i> being essential to the
Deity, he was bound to maintain it at any cost, and
he thus felt himself constrained to embrace the idea
of a divine Trinity. Against this doctrine Servetus
levelled his bitterest sarcasms. The Spaniard rejected
what he denominated an 'imaginary Trinity;' he
called those who believed in it 'tritheists,' or even
atheists, and abused them in coarse language. 'Jesus
is man,' he said; 'the Godhead was communicated to
Him by grace, but He is not God by nature. The
Father alone is God in that sense.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_180" id="Ref_180" href="#Foot_180">[180]</a></span>
He invited Calvin
to a conference; puffed up and charmed with his
own system, he fancied himself certain to convince
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
the reformer, and flattered himself with the hope of
making him his fellow-labourer.</p>

<p>The task was not an easy one. The object of the
Reformation was to raise a spiritual temple, wherein
troubled souls might find a refuge; and Calvin saw
rash hands presuming to make it a receptacle for every
error, and, in his own energetic language, 'a den for
murdering souls.' He stood forth, therefore, to maintain
the apostolic doctrine, and contended that Christ,
who called himself the <i>only</i> Son of God, was a <i>son</i>, not
like believers, in consequence of adoption; not like the
angels, because of their communion with the Lord;
but in the proper sense: and that if the son of a man
has the nature of a man like his father, Jesus, the only
Son of God, has in like manner the nature of God.</p>

<p>It was a question that seriously occupied many
minds at this period. Servetus did not stand alone;
other doctors, as Hetzer, Denck, Campanus, and Joris,
had professed analogous errors. One universal cry
was heard among the reformers when they saw Christ's
divinity attacked. Luther had declared that 'this
little spark would cause a great conflagration;'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_181" id="Ref_181" href="#Foot_181">[181]</a></span>
Zwingle had demanded that 'this false, wicked, and
pernicious doctrine' should be opposed by every means;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_182" id="Ref_182" href="#Foot_182">[182]</a></span>
and even the moderate Bucer, forgetting his
christian gentleness, had gone so far as to declare from
the pulpit that 'a man like Servetus deserved to have
his bowels plucked out and his body torn to pieces.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_183" id="Ref_183" href="#Foot_183">[183]</a></span>
Calvin resolved to accept Servetus's invitation. These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">{103}</a></span>
two young men, born in the same year, gifted each of
them with marvellous genius, unshakeable in their
convictions, are about to enter the lists. What blows
they will deal each other! What a struggle! Which
will come off conqueror? If Luther, Zwingle, and
Bucer are so animated, what will Calvin be? He was
the one who showed the most moderate sentiments
with regard to Servetus. Alas! why did he not continue
so to the last? 'I will do all in my power to
cure Servetus,' he said.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_184" id="Ref_184" href="#Foot_184">[184]</a></span>
'If I show myself in public,
I know that I expose my life; but I will spare no
pains to bring him to such sentiments, that <i>all pious
men may be able to take him affectionately by the hand</i>.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_185" id="Ref_185" href="#Foot_185">[185]</a></span>
Justice requires that we should take account of these
feelings of Calvin with regard to Servetus.</p>

<p class="side">=A DISCUSSION APPOINTED.=</p>

<p>The discussion was therefore resolved upon, and a
certain number of friends were invited to be present.
The time and place were settled, and when the day
arrived, Calvin quitted De la Forge's house, and, proceeding
down the Rue St. Martin to the Rue St. Antoine,
found himself at the appointed hour at a house
in this latter street, which had been selected for the
colloquy. Servetus had not come, and Calvin waited
for him; still the Spaniard did not appear, and the
Frenchman was patient. What was the cause of his
delay? Had Lieutenant-criminal Morin obtained
information of the meeting, and was he preparing to
catch the two young leaders by one cast of his net?
After waiting for some time to no purpose, Calvin withdrew.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_186" id="Ref_186" href="#Foot_186">[186]</a></span>
Servetus, who lived as a catholic in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
midst of catholics, and made no scruple of taking part
in the worship of the Roman church, probably feared
that a public discussion with Calvin would make him
known, and expose him to serious danger.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_187" id="Ref_187" href="#Foot_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>Servetus's challenge was not however without consequences.
He had called Calvin into the lists, he had
made him the champion of the doctrine of the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost; the opportunity of answering
this challenge occurred twenty years later at Geneva.
If the struggle had then been confined to a learned
discussion between these two great minds, it would
have been right enough; Servetus himself had challenged
it. But the ideas of the times, from which
Calvin (even while seeking a relaxation in the form)
could not free himself, led to one of those distressing
calamities, so frequent during a long series of ages in
the annals of Rome, but of which, God be thanked!
there is only this one instance in those of the Reformation.</p>

<p>Calvin did not fight only with the tongue: he was
then hurrying on the printing of his first theological
work. It was the book written against those who
said 'that the soul was only the motion of the lungs,
and that if it had been endowed with immortality at
the creation, it had been deprived of it by the fall.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_188" id="Ref_188" href="#Foot_188">[188]</a></span>
'Let us put down those people,' he said, 'who murder
souls without appearing to inflict any wounds:' and
with this view he had composed a work on the <i>Immortality
of the Soul</i>, the title given it in a letter he
wrote to Fabri.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_189" id="Ref_189" href="#Foot_189">[189]</a></span>
It is to be regretted that he afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
substituted the rather awkward one of <i>Psychopannychia</i>,
'the night or sleep of the soul;' as the first
indicates the subject more clearly. At the same time
also he combated the opinion of those 'good men,' as
he calls them,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_190" id="Ref_190" href="#Foot_190">[190]</a></span>
who believed that the soul slept until
the judgment-day. The first edition of this work,
which bears the date of Paris 1534, came out probably
immediately after Calvin had left that city or shortly
before his departure.</p>

<p class="side">=CHARACTER OF CALVIN'S DIVINITY.=</p>

<p>This work gave him a place apart in the ranks of
the reformers. In this his earliest theological treatise
he displayed the character that distinguished him, and
which those who surrounded him had already been
able to recognise in his conversations. His theology
would not be negative, but on the contrary exceedingly
positive. His first work does not combat the errors
of Rome. He stands forth as the defender of the soul,
the advocate of christian spiritualism. He will be, as
a great historian has said, 'the man called to build the
Lord's citadel, of which Luther had laid the foundation.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_191" id="Ref_191" href="#Foot_191">[191]</a></span>
The force of conviction, the weight of proof,
the power with which he employed the Scriptures, the
simplicity and clearness of style, struck every reader.
We shall not speak here of Calvin as a writer: we
have done so elsewhere.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_192" id="Ref_192" href="#Foot_192">[192]</a></span>
There might, however, be
discerned in this work a defect of which Calvin never
entirely cured himself: it contained energetic disdain
and bitter invective. He saw this himself; he did
more, he moderated these expressions in a second
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
edition. 'I said certain things in it,' he wrote, referring
to the first, 'with a bitterness and severity which
may have offended certain delicate ears.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_193" id="Ref_193" href="#Foot_193">[193]</a></span>
I have therefore struck out some passages, added others, and
changed many.' This did not prevent his falling into
the same fault again, which, it must be acknowledged,
was that of the age.</p>

<p>In spite of his frequent discussions, Calvin was
happy in the house of De la Forge. Accustomed to a
frugal life, he was little affected by the abundance of
all sorts of good things by which he was surrounded;
but the piety of the family delighted him much. He
loved to see the master distributing the Gospel, relieving
the poor, and listening to the interpretation of
God's word, and took pleasure in his christian conversation.
'Most assuredly,' he said, 'true happiness
is not circumscribed within the narrow limits of this
frail life, and yet God promises also to believers a
happy life, even in this pilgrimage and earthly dwelling-place,
so far as the state of the world permits.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_194" id="Ref_194" href="#Foot_194">[194]</a></span>
But the happiness of this blessed household was not
to be of long duration. Lieutenant-criminal Morin
was ere long to enter it, throw the wife into prison,
lead the husband to the scaffold, and change the happiness
of a peaceful christian family into sorrow,
groans, and tears.</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN RESOLVES TO LEAVE PARIS.=</p>

<p>Would De la Forge be the only victim? Would the
first blows be aimed at him? Would they not be
aimed at Calvin, the author of that bold address which
had thrown both city and university into confusion?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>
Could the friend of Rector Cop long remain in the
capital without once more exciting the attention of
his enemies? A great persecution was about to
burst forth, and if Calvin had been living in the Rue
St. Martin at that time, he would doubtless have been
seized along with the pious tradesman, burnt like the
other martyrs, and the history of his life would have
shrunk to a paragraph in the simple annals of Crespin's
<i>Martyrs</i>. But the Father in heaven did not permit that
<i>this sparrow should then fall to the ground</i>. Calvin
had powerful motives which urged him to leave France.
His time in Paris was so taken up with visits, interviews,
and other business, that he sank under the
burden, without being able to discharge what he looked
upon as his first duty. He was called to be a teacher
rather than a mere preacher of the Gospel. To accomplish
the great task he had set himself, he needed
repose, leisure, and study, besides interviews and conferences
with other theologians. He adopted a great
resolution. 'I shall leave France,' he said, 'and go
to Germany in order to find in some obscure corner
the quiet refused to me elsewhere.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_195" id="Ref_195" href="#Foot_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Du Tillet had determined to accompany him. The
two friends made their preparations; they procured
two horses and two servants; and one day towards the
end of July Calvin bade farewell to the pious tradesman
who had been as a brother to him. Their clothes
were packed away in portmanteaus, in one of which
they hid their money, and then they were fastened
on the crupper; and so the travellers departed, the
masters on horseback, the servants on foot.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></div>

<p>'On reaching the frontier,' says a catholic historian,
'Calvin could not restrain his emotion; he lifted up
his voice in distress that France rejected the men whom
God sent her, and even tried to murder them.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_196" id="Ref_196" href="#Foot_196">[196]</a></span>
This exclamation appears rather doubtful, and the historian
who reports it is not always accurate. Still it is possible
and not unnatural.</p>

<p>The travellers having entered Lorraine, stopped at
Delme near Nancy, where they halted and walked
about the town. During this time one of their servants,
who knew where the money had been hidden, took advantage
of their absence, placed the valise on the best
of the two horses, and rode away as fast as he could.
When Calvin and Du Tillet returned, they discovered
the robbery. They wished to pursue the thief, but
could not catch him.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_197" id="Ref_197" href="#Foot_197">[197]</a></span>
The two friends were greatly
embarrassed, when the other servant approached and
offered them ten crowns which he had with him. They
accepted his offer and were able to reach Strasburg.</p>

<p>If Calvin had remained in his own country, he
would never have been able to fulfil the career to
which he was called; he had no other prospect but
the stake. And yet, he will indeed be her reformer....
True, he quitted her, but a divine hand fixed him as
near as possible to that land of his affections and of
his sorrows. From the picturesque valley, whence
the Rhone continually pours its waves into France,
God was about to scatter by Calvin's means, throughout
all the provinces of that great kingdom, the living
waters of the Gospel of Christ.</p>

 <span style="font-size:80%">THE PLACARDS.<br />
 (<span class="smc">October 1534.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CALVIN had hardly left Paris when the clouds
gathered over the little church of the metropolis.
'There was no year,' says a chronicler of the sixteenth
century, speaking of 1534, 'when such great marvels
happened in divers countries; but of all these marvels
none is more worthy to be remembered than that
which caused it to be named <i>the year of the placards</i>.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_198" id="Ref_198" href="#Foot_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>The christians of Paris met together frequently in
one another's houses. 'The Lord,' said they, 'commands
His disciples to go forth and scatter the doctrine
of salvation into all corners of the world.' The hive
was swarming, as it had recently done at Poitiers.
Le Comte, whom we have mentioned, quitted his
friends, and after many dangers reached Morat, to
assist Farel in his evangelical work.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_199" id="Ref_199" href="#Foot_199">[199]</a></span>
Another Lutheran,
whose journey was to be productive of disastrous
results, followed the same road not long after.</p>

<p class="side">=TEMPORISERS AND SCRIPTURISTS.=</p>

<p>There were, as we have seen, two distinct parties
among the evangelical christians of France: the
<i>temporisers</i> and the <i>scripturists</i>. They sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">{110}</a></span>
came in contact, and each of them resolutely defended
their own views. The <i>temporisers</i> looked to Margaret,
to the king her brother, and to alliances with
Henry VIII. and the Protestants of Germany.
Knowing that Francis I. detested the monks, they
hoped, with the help of the Du Bellays, to give France
a moderate reform, and desired to do nothing that
might offend him. They waited.</p>

<p>As for the <i>scripturists</i>, that is to say, the evangelicals
of the school of Calvin, diplomacy made them feel
uneasy; the king's protection annoyed them, and the
idea of recognising the bishops and the pope alarmed
them. They saw all kinds of superstition following in
the train of the hierarchy, and they were determined
to resist stoutly everything that might bring back the
<i>idols</i> to the temple of God.</p>

<p class="side">=FERET SENT TO CONSULT FAREL.=</p>

<p>As the two parties could not come to an understanding,
they determined to send one of their number
to Switzerland, in order to obtain the opinion of
Farel and the other refugees. Should they wait or
should they act?—such was the question they put.
They selected for that consultation a simple, pious,
intelligent Christian, by name Feret, who belonged to
the royal pharmacy: he accepted the mission and
departed. No one suspected at that time that this
journey would lead to an explosion that would shake
the capital, terrify France, and perhaps destroy the
cause of the Reformation.</p>

<p>Feret proceeded to Switzerland. He had hardly
crossed the Jura when a striking spectacle met his
eyes. Everything was in commotion, as in a hive of
bees. Farel, Viret, Saunier, Olivetan, Froment,
Marcourt, Hollard, Le Comte, and others besides,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
coming from Dauphiny, Basle, Paris, Strasburg, or
belonging to the country, were boldly preaching the
evangelical doctrine everywhere. At Neufchatel all
<i>idolatry</i> had been removed from public worship; and
the same had been done at Aigle, and in its four
<i>mandements</i>. Orbe, Grandson, and the Pays de
Vaud were beginning to make up their minds; Geneva
was tottering; the old Waldenses of Piedmont
were holding out their hands to the new reformers. In
many places they were even 'destroying the altars and
breaking down the images,' according to the command
in Deuteronomy.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_200" id="Ref_200" href="#Foot_200">[200]</a></span>
What a contrast with the timid
precautions of the christians of Paris! Feret was
quite struck with it, and that alone was an answer.</p>

<p>He explained to the christians to whom he was
accredited the very different state of things at Paris;
he described the difficulties of France and the two
parties that existed among the reformed, and asked for
their advice. Farel and his friends held that a subject
ought not to rise in rebellion against his lord, but
if the king of France commanded anything forbidden
by the King of heaven, it was necessary to obey him
who was the master of the other. These decided
christians rejected all those medleys of the Gospel
and popery that Francis I., Margaret of Navarre, Du
Bellay, and even Melanchthon (as it was said) desired.
'These two (the Gospel and the pope) cannot exist
together,' they said, 'any more than fire and water.'
The mass especially, that main point of the Romish
doctrine, must, in their opinion, be abolished. If the
papal hierarchy was the tree whose deadly shade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
killed the living seeds of the Word, the mass was its
root. It must be plucked up, and thus prevented
from stretching its fatal branches any longer over the
wide field of Christendom. The writing and posting
of placards were proposed.</p>

<p>What indeed could be done? Oppression kept the
boldest voices silent. It was necessary to draw up an
energetic protest against error, and place it at the
same moment, if possible, before the eyes of all
France. Farel undertook the task; he could not
write without making use of 'his trenchant style and
thundering eloquence.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_201" id="Ref_201" href="#Foot_201">[201]</a></span>
He reflected on the evils that
afflicted his country. Indignation guided his daring
pen; his style was uneven, harsh perhaps, but masculine,
nervous, and full of fire. At length the evangelical
protest was written, and Farel laid it before his brethren,
who accepted it, believing that it would be <i>like a
hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces</i>. The document
was taken to the printer's, and came out in
two forms: in placards to be posted up against the
walls, and little tracts that were to be dropped in the streets.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_202" id="Ref_202" href="#Foot_202">[202]</a></span>
The sheets were packed up and intrusted
to the care of Feret, who departed with
the precious bales containing 'the thunderbolt forged
on Farel's anvil.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_203" id="Ref_203" href="#Foot_203">[203]</a></span>
No one stopped him at the frontier;
he traversed Franche-Comté, Burgundy, and
Champagne without difficulty, and arrived in Paris.</p>

<p class="side">=DISCUSSION ABOUT THE PLACARDS.=</p>

<p>The evangelical christians of the capital, impatient
to receive news from Switzerland, assembled hastily,
and Feret laid the placard before them. Those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">{113}</a></span>
energetic words, written at the foot of the Jura,
seemed strangely bold when they were read under the
walls of the Sorbonne, and at the gates of the Louvre.
That brave and pious minister, Courault, came forward
in the meeting as the organ of the 'men of judgment,'
as they were afterwards called. 'Let us beware of
posting up these placards,' he said; 'we shall only
inflame the rage of our adversaries thereby, and
increase the dispersion of believers.' But on the
other hand, those who were alarmed at the steps taken
by Francis I. to unite the pope and the Gospel were
delighted. 'Let us be cautious of so squaring our
prudence,' they said, 'that it does not make us act
like cowards. If we look timidly from one side to the
other to see how far we can go without exposing our
lives, we shall forsake Jesus Christ.' In their view it
was of importance to confess the Lord in the sight of
France, and in order to do so, they were ready, like
the martyrs of old, to encounter death. Many of the
opposite party gave way, and the publication of the
placard was resolved on. These sincere Christians
were so firmly convinced of the divinity of their doctrine,
and so full of faith, that they expected an intervention
from God—not a miraculous one indeed, but
an extraordinary one—'a rushing mighty wind from
heaven,' and 'cloven tongues like as of fire,' which
should kindle all hearts. They thought that God
would by this declaration open to France the gate of
His spiritual treasures.</p>

<p>The consultation continued. Where should they
circulate this paper? asked some. 'All over Paris,'
was the reply:—'All over France,' answered others.
They were not unknown individuals who deliberated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span>
thus: the wealthy tradesman, Du Bourg, and his
friends were there, and if Bartholomew Milon could
not act, at least he gave advice which was to cost him
dear. The warmest friends of the Reformation shared
the work between them: each man had his district,
his province. 'They portioned out the kingdom in
order to do <i>the same in every city</i>,' says the catholic
Fontaine; and the night of the 24th of October was
appointed for this daring enterprise.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_204" id="Ref_204" href="#Foot_204">[204]</a></span>
The placards were divided among those who were to post them up
or to distribute them. Knowing that unless God made
the truth enter into the heart, they would do nothing
but <i>beat the air in vain</i>,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_205" id="Ref_205" href="#Foot_205">[205]</a></span>
these pious men exhorted
one another to 'pray to God with fervent zeal.' Then
every man returned home, carrying with him a bundle
of placards and a parcel of tracts.</p>

<p class="side">=THE PLACARDS POSTED UP.=</p>

<p>When the night came, the selected men left their
houses, carrying the printed sheets in their hands;
and each one did his duty in his quarter, silently
and mysteriously. The fervent christian who thus
hazarded his life, took, however, certain precautions;
he listened to hear if any one were coming, hastily
stuck the bill on the wall, and then glided noiselessly
away to some other place, where he posted up another.
In a short time the streets, market-places, and crossways
were covered with the evangelical proclamation,
some being fixed even on the walls of the Louvre.
As the day appeared, most of these daring men
returned home; but others hid themselves, and from
a distance watched to see what would happen.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></div>

<p>A few persons began to come out of doors; they
went up to the large handbills and stopped to examine
them. Gradually a crowd was formed, some friars approached:
hundreds of persons of every class collected
round the strange placards. They were read aloud,
remarks were made upon them, and the most diverse
sentiments were expressed; many persons gave vent
to indignation and threats; some approved, the greater
part were astounded. The crowd was particularly
large in the streets of St. Denis and St. Honoré, in
the Place Royale, in the city, at the gates of the
churches, and of the Sorbonne and the Louvre. Let
us read this terrible handbill, as it was read in the
streets of the capital. The public of our age will find
it too severe and possibly too long, and we must
abridge it a little; but the men of the sixteenth century
read it to the end, and notwithstanding its defects, its
action was powerful. Like the shock of an earthquake,
it made all France tremble. It began with a
solemn invocation:—</p>

 <p style="line-height:200%" class="center small">TRUTHFUL ARTICLES<br />
 CONCERNING THE HORRIBLE, GREAT, AND UNBEARABLE ABUSES<br />
 OF THE POPISH MASS,<br />
 INVENTED DIRECTLY<br />
 AGAINST THE HOLY SUPPER OF OUR LORD,<br />
 THE ONLY MEDIATOR AND ONLY SAVIOUR, JESUS CHRIST.</p>

<p>'I invoke heaven and earth in witness of the truth
against that proud and pompous popish mass, for the
world (if God does not apply a remedy) is and will
be by it totally desolated, ruined, lost, and undone;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
seeing that in it our Lord is outrageously blasphemed,
and the people blinded and led astray. Which ought
not to be borne any longer.</p>

<p>'In the first place, every believing christian ought
to be very certain that our Lord and only Saviour,
Jesus Christ, the great bishop and pastor ordained of
God, has given His body and soul, His life and blood
for our sanctification, by a perfect sacrifice. To
renounce this sacrifice as if it were insufficient, to
replace it by a visible sacrifice, namely, the mass, as if
Christ had not fully satisfied for us the justice of His
Father, and as if He were not the Saviour and Mediator,
would be a terrible and damnable heresy.</p>

<p>'The world has been, and in many places still is,
filled with wretched high-priests, who, as if they were
our redeemers, set themselves in Christ's place, and
pretend to offer an acceptable sacrifice to God for the
salvation both of the living and the dead: do not these
people make the apostles and evangelists liars, and do
they not even belie themselves, since they chant every
Sunday at vespers that Jesus Christ is a <i>priest for
ever</i>?...</p>

<p>'Yes, by the great and admirable sacrifice of Jesus
Christ all outward and visible sacrifice is abolished.
Christ, says the Epistle to the Hebrews (which I
entreat everybody to read diligently), <i>was offered once
for all.—By one offering he hath perfected for ever them
that are sanctified.</i> Christ offered <i>once</i> and not <i>often</i>....
If the sacrifice is perfect, why should it be repeated?...
Come forward then, ye priests, and
answer if ye can!</p>

<p>'That is not all. By this unhappy mass the whole
world has been plunged into a common idolatry. Are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>
we not given to understand falsely that under the
forms of bread and wine Jesus Christ is corporeally,
really, and personally contained, in flesh and bone, as
long, broad, and entire as when He was alive?...
And yet Holy Scripture and our faith teaches us the
contrary, that Jesus Christ, after his resurrection,
ascended into heaven. St. Paul writes to the Colossians,
<i>Seek those things which are above, where</i>
<span class="smc">Christ sitteth on the Right Hand of God</span>. Listen: St.
Paul does not say: Seek Christ who is in the mass,
or in the sanctuary, or in the box, or in the cupboard.
He says: Seek Christ <i>who is in heaven</i>. If the body
is in heaven, it is not on earth; and if it is on earth,
it is not in heaven. A real body can never be in
more than one place at a time, where it occupies a
certain space of a certain size. It is impossible for
a man twenty or thirty years old to be hidden in a bit
of dough like their wafer.</p>

<p>'Augustin knew this well when he wrote: "Until
the world comes to an end, <i>the Lord is on high</i>; but
His divinity is everywhere."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_206" id="Ref_206" href="#Foot_206">[206]</a></span>
And so did Fulgentius,
when he wrote: "The Lord was absent from heaven,
according to his human nature, when he was on earth;
and <i>he left the earth when he ascended to heaven</i>. But
as for the divine nature, it never quitted heaven when
he came down to earth, and did not leave the earth
when he ascended to heaven."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_207" id="Ref_207" href="#Foot_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>'When any one of us says: <i>Lo, here is Christ, or
there</i>! the priests say: We must believe him. But
Christ says: <i>Believe it not</i>. At the moment of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
communion they chant <i>Sursum corda</i>, Lift your
hearts on high; but they do the contrary, and exhort
us to seek Christ not <i>on high</i>, but in their hands, in
their boxes, and in their cupboards.</p>

<p>'Nay, further, these blind priests, adding error to
error, teach in their madness, that after they have
breathed upon or spoken over the bread, which they
take between their fingers, and also over the wine that
they put in the chalice, there remains neither bread
nor wine, but that Jesus Christ is there alone by <i>transubstantiation</i>....
Big and monstrous words ...
doctrine of devils, opposed to all Scripture. I ask
these cope-wearers, Where did they find that big word
<span class="smc">Transubstantiation</span>?... St. Matthew, St. Mark,
St. John, St. Paul, and the old Fathers never spoke
of it. When they made mention of the Lord's Supper,
those holy writers openly and simply called the bread
and wine, <i>bread</i> and <i>wine</i>. St. Paul does not say:
Eat the body of Jesus Christ; but: Eat this <i>bread</i>.
Ah! Scripture employs no deception, and there is no
pretence in it. The bread is therefore bread.</p>

<p>'Presumptuous enemies of the Word of God,
shameless heretics, they are not satisfied with pretending
to enclose the body of Jesus Christ in their
wafer; but see into what absurdities their superstition
leads them. They are not ashamed to say that the
body of Jesus Christ may be eaten by rats, spiders, and
vermin.... Yes, there it is printed in red letters in
their missals, in the twenty-second Item, beginning
thus: If the body of the Lord be eaten by mice and
spiders, be reduced to nothing, or be very much gnawed,
or if the maggot is found whole inside ... let it be
burned and placed in the reliquary!</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></div>

<p>'O earth! why openest thou not to swallow up these
horrible blasphemers? O hateful men! Is that gnawed
body really the body of Jesus Christ, the Son of
God?... Would the Lord suffer Himself to be
eaten by mice and spiders? He who is the bread of
angels and of all the children of God, has been given
us to feed vermin? Him, who is incorruptible, at the
right hand of God, will you make liable to worms and
rottenness? Did not David write the contrary, prophesying
his own resurrection?... Wretches! were
there no other evil in all your infernal theology than
the irreverence with which you speak of the precious
body of Jesus, are you not blasphemers and heretics?... yea,
the greatest and most enormous the world
has ever seen.</p>

<p>'Kindle, yes, kindle your faggots, but let it be to
burn and roast yourselves.... Why should you kindle
them for us? Because we will not believe in your
idols, in your new Gods, in your new Christs, who
let themselves be eaten by vermin, and in you also,
who are worse than vermin.</p>

<p>'What mean all these games you play round your
God of dough, toying with him like a cat with a
mouse? You break him into three pieces ... and
then you put on a piteous look as if you were very
sorrowful; you beat your breasts ... you call him the
Lamb of God, and pray to him for peace. St. John
showed Jesus Christ ever present, ever living, living
all in one—an adorable truth! but you show your
wafer divided into pieces, and then you eat it, calling
for something to drink.... What would any man
say who had never witnessed such monkey tricks?...
Did St. Paul or St. John ever eat Christ in that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
manner? and would they acknowledge such mountebanks
as the servants of God?</p>

<p>'Finally the practice of your mass is very contrary
to the practice of the Holy Supper of Jesus Christ!...
Certainly, there is no marvel in that, for there is
nothing common between Christ and Belial.</p>

<p>'The Holy Supper of Jesus Christ reminds us of the
great love with which He loved us so that He washed
us in His blood. It presents to us on the part of the
Lord the body and blood of His Son, in order that
we should communicate in the sacrifice of His death,
and that Jesus should be our everlasting food. It
calls us to make protest of our faith, and of the certain
confidence we have of being saved, Jesus having
ransomed us. By giving to all of us only one bread
it reminds us of the charity in which we, being all of
the same spirit, ought to live. That Holy Supper,
being thus fully understood, rejoices the believer's
soul, in all humility, and imparts to him all gentle
kindness and loving charity.</p>

<p>'But the fruit of the mass is very different. By it
the preaching of the Gospel is prevented. The time
is occupied with bell-ringing, howling, chanting,
empty ceremonies, candles, incense, disguises, and all
manner of conjuration. And the poor world, looked
upon as a lamb or as sheep, is miserably deceived,
cajoled, led astray—what do I say? bitten, gnawed,
and devoured as if by ravening wolves.</p>

<p>'By means of this mass they have laid hands on
everything, destroyed everything, swallowed up everything.
By its means they have disinherited princes
and kings, lords and shopkeepers, and all whom we
could name, dead or alive.... O false witnesses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span>
traitors, robbers of the honour of God, and more hateful
than the devils themselves!</p>

<p>'In short, the truth chases them, the truth alarms
them, and by truth shall their reign shortly be destroyed
for ever.'</p>

<p>Such was the proclamation posted up in Paris
and all over France. We trace in it, we must
confess, the coarseness of the language of the sixteenth
century, and especially in a passage which
must have greatly stirred the anger of the clergy,
where the placard, in speaking of the pope and cardinals,
priests and monks, calls them false prophets,
wolves, seducers, and gives them other names besides,
which are rarely employed in our days except in the
bulls of the Roman pontiffs. We discover in this
writing the antipapistical spirit in all its unreflecting
force. Certainly, when it says that the true Supper
of Christ 'rejoices the believer's soul, and imparts to
him all gentle kindness and loving charity,' we taste
the savour of the Gospel; but, generally speaking, this
manifesto is an engine of war with a brazen head. If
we transport ourselves to the early days of the Reformation,
we can understand that it was necessary to
employ vigorous battering-rams to beat down the old
and apparently unshakeable walls of popery. Every
line in this placard reveals to us the warm-hearted, but
also 'the impetuous and eloquent Farel, frank, decisive,
intrepid among men, who had the admirable
heart of the knight without reproach, with his thirst
for danger, and was the Bayard of the battles of God.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_208" id="Ref_208" href="#Foot_208">[208]</a></span>
The work resembles the workman.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span></p>

<p>While conceding something to the times in which
the placard was written and posted up, we may ask
whether that act proceeded solely from a movement
of the mind free from every tinge of human passion,
and was one of the arms that the apostles would have
employed. In any case it seems to us certain that
more moderate language would really have been
stronger, and more surely have attained its end.
This is what the event will show.</p>

<p class="side">=A NEW MISSIVE.=</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE terrible placard posted up during the night in
Paris and over a great part of France, 'in every
corner,' says Sturm,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_209" id="Ref_209" href="#Foot_209">[209]</a></span>
produced an immense sensation.
The people were agitated, the women and the weak
alarmed, and the magistrates filled with indignation.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_210" id="Ref_210" href="#Foot_210">[210]</a></span>
But the adversaries of popery did not relax their
blows. At almost the same time there appeared
another treatise 'against the pope's traffickers and
taverners.' This writing, which was less evangelical,
was rather in the mocking spirit of Erasmus. 'Everything
must subserve the cupidity of the priests,' it
said; 'heaven, earth, and hell, time, all creatures
animate and inanimate, wine, bread, and oil, flax,
milk, butter, cheese, water, salt, fire, and fumigations....
From all these they knew how to extract ...
silver and gold. And the dress of the dealer adds to
the price of his wares, for a mass by an abbot or a
bishop costs more than one by a curate or a friar.
Like women of ill fame, they sell their shame all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
the dearer the gayer the ornaments they wear.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_211" id="Ref_211" href="#Foot_211">[211]</a></span>
The agitation increased hourly; priests and friars,
scattered among the groups of citizens and people,
fomented their anger, increased their terror, and circulated
false reports. 'The heretics,' it was said,
'have resolved to surprise the catholics during divine
service, and to murder men, women, and children
without mercy.' An absurd imputation, invented,
says a Romish historian, to make the reformers odious.
It was believed all the same, and horrible rumours
began shortly to circulate among the crowd. 'A
frightful plot has been laid against the State and the
Church. This placard is the signal; the heretics
intend to fire the churches and palaces, massacre the
catholics, abolish the monarchy, and reduce the kingdom
to a desert.... Death to the Lutherans!'</p>

<p>Nowhere was the fury so great as at the Sorbonne
among the doctors: the first outbreak of their anger
was incredibly violent.'This action,' says the
chronicler, 'led them into such fury that their former
violence seemed tolerable. No tempest ever equalled
it in severity.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_212" id="Ref_212" href="#Foot_212">[212]</a></span>
The thunderbolt was destined, however,
to be launched from a different quarter.</p>

<p>Francis I., who was then at Blois, had for some time
felt a certain uneasiness with regard to the Reform.
One day in 1534, when he was complaining of the
pope to the nuncio, and insinuating that France might
easily imitate the example of Henry VIII., 'Frankly,
sire,' replied the nuncio, 'you will be the first to
suffer; the religion of a people cannot be changed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span>
without their next demanding the change of the
prince.' It had been of no use to tell Francis that
neither the German princes, nor Henry VIII. himself,
had been dethroned by the Reformation: the nuncio's
words had sunk like an arrow into his heart.</p>

<p class="side">=THE PLACARD ON THE KING'S DOOR.=</p>

<p>Blois was not exempt from the evangelical movement,
and the Reform had made its way among the
choristers of the royal chapel: it was one of these who
was commissioned to post up the placards in that
city. Being of a daring and enthusiastic temperament,
this individual resolved to post the protestant
manifesto in the castle itself, to which he had easy access.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_213" id="Ref_213" href="#Foot_213">[213]</a></span>
Entering it at a favourable moment, he
crept with his handbills as far as the king's chamber,
and being satisfied that there were no servants or
courtiers in the gallery, he fastened the paper to His
Majesty's door, and then retired hastily.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_214" id="Ref_214" href="#Foot_214">[214]</a></span>
This imprudent and guilty action, for it was disrespectful,
was to be cruelly atoned for.</p>

<p>Montmorency and the Cardinal de Tournon appeared
in the morning before the king as was their
custom. They had the ear of Francis I., and had
long been looking for an opportunity to deal a desperate
blow at the Reformation. Just as these two
personages were about to enter the king's closet, they
caught sight of the placard posted on the door; they
stopped and read it, and taking the matter seriously,
not without reason, they tore down the paper angrily,
and carried it in to their master.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_215" id="Ref_215" href="#Foot_215">[215]</a></span>
Nothing in the world could excite him so much as an attack like that:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span>
his royal dignity was in his eyes almost as sacred as
the Divine majesty. He trembled and turned pale;
he took the paper and then gave it back, and disturbed
by such unheard-of audacity, he ordered them to
read it.</p>

<p class="side">=THE KING'S INDIGNATION.=</p>

<p>It was what Tournon wanted. He read the document
to the king, dwelling on the most irritating
passages; but the prince could not hold out to the end.
The insult offered to his person, the impression which
such a public scandal might produce on his allies,
and especially on the pope, the reflection that at the
very moment when he was preparing the reconciliation
of protestants and catholics, a few fanatics should stir
up all the passions of the priests and the people, and
cause his pacific designs to fail—all this exasperated
his mind more than the attack upon the mass. Those
who were about him took advantage of the opportunity,
and represented the affair as one of high-treason.
Montmorency and De Tournon drove the
bolt deep into the king's heart. 'He burst into a
transport of passion,' wrote Sturm to Melanchthon;
'he was so inflamed,' says the <i>Book of Martyrs</i>;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_216" id="Ref_216" href="#Foot_216">[216]</a></span>
'he put himself in such a rage,' says Theodore Beza; 'he
became so hot that everybody trembled about him,'
says the catholic Fontaine.—'Let all be seized without
distinction,' he exclaimed, 'who are suspected of
<i>Lutheresy</i>. I will exterminate them all.'</p>

<p>The event caused a great agitation; nothing else
was talked of, and every one described it in his own
manner. 'Do you know,' said some, 'that the king,
in the very height of his passion, taking his handkerchief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">{127}</a></span>
from his pocket, pulled out a placard, which fell
at his feet: some clever fellow had slipped the copy
in.' 'You may believe it, if you like,' says Fontaine,
estimating this popular story at its real value. The
whole household of the castle was immediately on the
alert to discover the author of the misdeed, which was
no hard matter. The Lutheran opinions of the
chorister were known to many; he was arrested, put
in chains, and sent to Paris to be tried.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_217" id="Ref_217" href="#Foot_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>But the king's wrath was not to be confined to this
man. The crime had been committed everywhere,
the punishment must be inflicted everywhere. 'Write
and order the parliament to execute strict justice,'
said the king; 'and tell the lieutenant-criminal that,
to encourage him, I increase his salary by six hundred
livres a year for life.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_218" id="Ref_218" href="#Foot_218">[218]</a></span>
Let inquisition be made forthwith
through all the realm for the people who are such enemies of God.'</p>

<p>The parliament had not waited for the king's orders.
On the morrow of the famous day, the 26th October,
the chief president, Pierre Lizet, convened all the
chambers, and the crowded court, being moved and
indignant, ordered a minute search and processions to
be made. The trumpets sounded, the people assembled,
and an officer of the parliament proclaimed:
'Whosoever shall give information as to the person or
persons who stuck up the said placards, he shall receive
from the court a reward of one hundred crowns; and
all who conceal them shall be burnt.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_219" id="Ref_219" href="#Foot_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>All this while the evangelical christians, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>
especially those who had set fire to the mine, alarmed
at the terrible explosion it had made, remained hidden
and silent in their houses. They knew Morin's skill
in discovering his victims and inventing tortures; a
dark future saddened their countenances. Then were
heard among them groans, and regrets, and mournful
deliberations. 'What shall we do?' they said. Take
flight!—What! leave home, and family, and country
without knowing where to go?... How gloomy the
future! But is it not better to lose all these than to
lose your life?... Such were the heart-rending conversations
held almost everywhere.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_220" id="Ref_220" href="#Foot_220">[220]</a></span>
Fathers and wives and children conjured with tears those whom they
loved to get out of the way of the king's anger. Some
of them, indeed, did leave their homes by night and flee.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_221" id="Ref_221" href="#Foot_221">[221]</a></span>
Many of those who had not posted the placards,
but who were known by the frank confession of their
faith, thought that the danger could not concern them....
The unhappy people hesitated and delayed, and
many of them paid dearly for their imprudent security.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_222" id="Ref_222" href="#Foot_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE BRETHREN BETRAYED.=</p>

<p>The lieutenant-criminal, a great opponent of the
religious movement, and a man of very dissolute life,
of rare audacity in catching criminals, and remarkable
subtlety in entrapping them by their answers,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_223" id="Ref_223" href="#Foot_223">[223]</a></span>
was meditating the plan of his campaign. His vanity,
his greed, his hatred—all his passions were engaged
in the business. He desired to catch all the heretics
together by one cast of his net. But how? A bright
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">{129}</a></span>
idea struck him: by seizing one man, he hoped to take
all the rest. 'You know that shop where they sell
sheaths and other such articles, in the Rue de la
Vannerie leading to the Grève,' he said to one of his
officers. 'Go and arrest the sheath-maker and bring
him to me.'—'Sheath-maker,' he said, 'you are one of
the heretics, and what is worse, you are their <i>convener</i>,
I know full well. It is you, do not deny it, who
inform them of the places where their secret meetings
are to be held. I have a wish to assemble them; you
will lead me to their houses.' The poor man, understanding
what he meant, tremblingly refused to
commit such treason. The lieutenant-criminal ordered
a scaffold to be got ready. As soon as the
officials had left the room, Morin turned to the sheath-maker:
'It is you that conduct the people to church,
and it is quite fair that you should begin the dance.'
The wretched man trembled. What a frightful alternative!
How could he go to those whom he was wont
to summon to the temple of God, in order to deliver
them to the flames? There was a terrible struggle in
his soul, but the fear of God was overcome, the light
of reason extinct, all regard for honour put aside.
'Satan entered into Judas,' and he sought how he
could betray his brethren. Believing himself 'on the
point of being burnt,' says Beza, he promised all
he was asked.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_224" id="Ref_224" href="#Foot_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Paris was all in commotion. The streets were hung
with drapery, processions were made, and in order to
wipe out the insult offered to the mass, the <i>Corpus
Domini</i> was carried solemnly through every parish.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_225" id="Ref_225" href="#Foot_225">[225]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
Morin took advantage of this agitation to conceal his
proceedings. The treacherous sheath-maker went before
him, pale and trembling; sergeants followed him
at a little distance, and this cruel company glided
silently through the streets. The sheath-maker stopped
and pointed to a door: Morin entered. The startled
family protested their innocence in vain. The lieutenant
ordered the poor creatures to be manacled, and
then continued his pitiless course. 'He spared no
house, great or small,' says the chronicler, 'not even
the colleges of the university of Paris.'</p>

<p class="side">=VALETON AND HIS BOOKS SEIZED.=</p>

<p>By degrees the news of this horrible expedition
spread through the capital; anguish seized not only
the friends of Farel, but all who were not fanatical
adherents of Rome, and even the mere followers
of learning or of pleasure, who had no taste for the
Reformation. 'Morin made all the city quake,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_226" id="Ref_226" href="#Foot_226">[226]</a></span>
for no one knew that he might not be among the number
of the suspected. In many houses a look-out was
kept, to observe whether the terrible troop was coming.
Nicholas Valeton the receiver, who kept near the
window, saw Morin approaching; hurriedly turning
away, he said to his wife: 'Here he is, take the chest
of books out of my room.... I will run and meet him;
I will speak to him and detain him, so as to give you
time.' The startled young woman took the books and
hastily thrust them into a hiding-place. 'Arrest this
man,' said the lieutenant-criminal, immediately he saw
Valeton; 'let him be put into close confinement.' He
then went upstairs and searched every corner, saw
the empty chest, but found nothing. Being impatient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
to interrogate his prisoner, he did not stop, but proceeded
straight to the prison whither he had been taken.
He could not entrap him. The receiver, being a clever
man, eluded all his questions. The lieutenant began
to grow nervous; thinking to himself that the receiver
had influence, and was a man likely to bear him a
grudge, he resolved to destroy him by proceeding more craftily.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_227" id="Ref_227" href="#Foot_227">[227]</a></span>
The empty chest recurred to his mind; it
must have contained something that had been removed
at his approach. He immediately returned to the house
of the accused, and standing near the chest, said in a
natural tone: 'Madame, your husband has confessed
that he kept his books and secret papers in this trunk.
Besides, we are agreed; I desire to behave mercifully
towards him; if you give a certain sum of money and
tell me where the books are, I swear to you before
God that your husband shall suffer no prejudice.' The
wife, who was 'young, thoughtless,' and much disturbed
by what had taken place, suffered herself to be
caught by this trick. Morin put so many 'crafty and
subtle questions,' that trusting in his promise, she told
him everything. 'Good!' thought the lieutenant-criminal,
'he wished to hide his books from us, because
he felt himself guilty of heresy.' Having seized them,
he left the house, and putting the papers in a place
of safety, went to look for other victims.</p>

<p>If there was one man in Paris who could not be
suspected of having fixed up the placards, it was the
poor paralytic: he could hardly leave his bed. That
was of no consequence; and Bartholomew Milon was
one of the first towards whose house Morin turned his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>
steps. He had had him in his prisons before this; 'but,'
says the <i>Book of Martyrs</i>, 'the Lord had delivered him
to make him serve for the consolation of his people in
this bitter season.' The lieutenant-criminal knew the
shoemaker's shop very well; it was noted down in
his books. He entered, like one out of his mind and
foaming with rage, into the room where poor Berthelot
was lying. 'Come, get up!' he cried, looking
fiercely at him. Bartholomew, 'not being terrified
by the hideous face of the tyrant,' replied, with a sweet
smile: 'Alas! sir, it wants a greater master than you
to make me rise.'—'Take this fellow away,' said the
brute to his creatures, and after ordering them to
carry with them a piece of furniture in which the
paralytic kept his papers, he continued his inglorious
campaign.</p>

<p class="side">=ARRESTS.=</p>

<p>The lieutenant-criminal now proceeded towards the
gate of St. Denis, to the sign of the <i>Black Horse</i>, and
entered the shop of the wealthy tradesman, Du Bourg.
When they caught sight of him, all who had any employment
there were startled; but although they
loved their master well, no one stirred to defend him.
The draper's wife, daughter of another rich tradesman
named Favereau, was not so tranquil: bursting into
tears and shrieking, she conjured the cruel Morin not
to take her husband away. Nothing could soften him,
and he arrested Du Bourg. 'He is one of those who
pasted up the papers at the corners of the streets,'
said the lieutenant, and took him away. Next came
the turn of the poor bricklayer, Poille, who was
captured in his wretched hut.</p>

<p>After them many persons without distinction of
rank or sex were shut up—those who had condemned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
the placards as well as those who had approved of
them. Informers were not wanting; they were given
a fourth part of the property of the accused, and
accordingly these <i>quadruplers</i> (as they were called)<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_228" id="Ref_228" href="#Foot_228">[228]</a></span>
were indefatigable in hunting out victims; each of
them could be accuser and witness in one. It was a
reign of terror, and all good people were astounded
at it.</p>

<p>The Sorbonne took advantage of this furious tempest
to be avenged on Margaret and to punish her
friends. That princess had quitted Béarn at the beginning
of summer to be present at the marriage of
her sister-in-law, Isabella of Navarre, with Viscount
de Rohan, and had obtained her brother's permission for
Roussel, who was with her, as well as Courault and
Berthaud, to preach in Paris. These moderate men
were strongly opposed to the act accomplished in the
night of the 25th October; they were thrown into
prison all the same. As there was no apprehension
of offending the king's allies, many Germans were
roughly seized, catholics as well as protestants; it
was enough to have a transrhenane accent to be suspected
of heresy.</p>

<p>In the meantime Francis I. arrived in Paris. Cardinals,
Sorbonne, Parliament, all the ardent friends of
Roman-catholicism, outvied each other in zeal to confirm
'this wise and good prince'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_229" id="Ref_229" href="#Foot_229">[229]</a></span>
in his religion,
which had been somewhat shaken. They must take
advantage of the crisis to detach him from his alliances
with the English and the Saxons. Now was the time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">{134}</a></span>
for striking the blow and for severing these guilty ties.
Cardinal de Tournon was particularly indefatigable
and continually calling for punishments. When Du
Chatel, bishop of Tulle, declared his opposition to
sanguinary measures: 'Your tolerance has a suspicious
look,' said De Tournon; 'it is unbecoming a true son
of the Church.'—'I am acting like a bishop,' answered
Du Chatel, firmly, 'and you like a hangman.' But
nothing could check either the Cardinal or Duprat.
They said to Francis: 'Carefully preserve the honour
which Pius II. gave our kings when he said: The
kings of France have this peculiarity, that they preserve
the catholic faith and the honour of churchmen;'
and added: 'We prevent the spreading of a fire, by
knocking down the houses which it has first touched,
and even the adjoining ones; do likewise, Sire; order
those to be exterminated utterly and without reserve,
who rebel against the Church. Kindle the fires and
erect gibbets for the use of the Lutherans.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_230" id="Ref_230" href="#Foot_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>A new act of madness (as some historians relate,
but which we can hardly believe) inflamed the king's
wrath still further. The very night of his arrival, we
are told, the placards reappeared and were stuck on
the gates of the Louvre. Nay more; it is asserted
that as Francis I. was going to bed, he found the
document under his pillow. The historian who records
these things is very prone to exaggeration,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_231" id="Ref_231" href="#Foot_231">[231]</a></span>
and I am inclined to think that such stories are mere fables
invented by the enemies of the Reform, its friends
being just then too terrified to show such boldness.</p>

<p class="side">=MARGARET'S SORROW.=</p>

<p>No one was more alarmed and more agitated than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span>
Margaret. Nothing was more opposed to her nature
than the style of the placards; and in reality they
were not only an attack against Rome, but a protest
against the conciliatory catholic system of the Queen
of Navarre. Those who protested in this way bore a
certain resemblance (not reckoning their Christianity)
to a well-known character in literature: they condemned
alike the fanatic Romanists and the spiritual
Catholics—</p>

</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The queen had not the slightest suspicion of the blow
that was preparing; and at the very moment when she
believed the Gospel to be on the point of gaining the
victory, everything seemed ended for it in France.
Her brother's anger, the hard look he turned upon her,
for perhaps the first time, alarmed this princess who
had, it is true, a strong understanding, but also a heart
easily moved and even timid. She shed floods of tears:
she had no doubt that the whole affair was the result
of a plot contrived between the Sorbonne and Cardinal
de Tournon. 'My lord,' she said to the king, 'we are
not sacramentarians. These infamous placards have
been invented by men who wish to make the responsibility
of their abominable manœuvre fall upon us.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_233" id="Ref_233" href="#Foot_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>She resolved to do everything to save Roussel at
least; the very thought that he might be burnt terrified
her. Why had she not left him at Pau? Seeing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span>
the unusual coldness of the king, she commissioned
the perfidious Montmorency to present her petition.
'They are occupied at this moment,' she wrote to
him, 'with completing their case against Master
Gérard; I hope the king will find him deserving
something better than the stake.... He has never
held an opinion tainted with heresy. I have known
him for five years, and if I had seen anything suspicious
in him, I should not have put up so long with
such poison. I entreat you, fear not to speak in my
behalf.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_234" id="Ref_234" href="#Foot_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>Montmorency, far from being disposed to do what
the queen asked, endeavoured to ruin not only
Roussel, but also Margaret herself; while Cardinals
Duprat and De Tournon helped him to insinuate into
the king's mind that his sister had some share in the
matter of the placards. The coldness, the harshness
even of Francis I. towards Margaret, increased daily;
heartbroken, and unable to bear up any longer, she
left Paris hastily.</p>

<p class="side">=BEDA ACCUSES FRANCIS.=</p>

<p>Some went further than Duprat and De Tournon,
and would have made their vengeance fall upon the
king himself. The impetuous Beda, that tribune of
the Sorbonne, who forgot neither his exile nor his
imprisonment, sought an opportunity of revenging himself
on the prince who had disgraced him. He hated
Francis cordially; to do him an injury for the mere
pleasure of doing it was his ambition. Not satisfied
with ascribing the placards to Queen Margaret, he
would accuse the king himself. Going into the
pulpit, he preached a sermon against that prince full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span>
of invective. 'If it is not the king who had these
bills posted up,' he said, 'at least he is responsible
for them. The favour he shows the heretics, and his
alliance with the King of England, are the cause of all
this mischief.' This time the priest was mistaken
in fancying himself more powerful than the sovereign.
Being accused before the parliament of high-treason,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_235" id="Ref_235" href="#Foot_235">[235]</a></span>
Beda was thrown into prison, condemned to do
penance in front of the church of Notre Dame, and
to be confined for the rest of his days in the
abbey of St. Michael, where he died. Thus perished
in obscurity this furious forerunner of the League.</p>

<p>The revolutionary fury of the Romish champion
softened Francis a little: finding himself accused as
well as his sister, he recalled her to Paris. The
queen, whose courage was as easily revived as it was
cast down, arrived at the Louvre full of hope, not
doubting that she would win over the king to the
golden mean she loved so dearly. But she found
Francis less accessible than she had fancied, and still
showing signs of his ill-humour. But this did not
stop her: imprudent and violent men had wished to
abolish the mass by means of a fanatical placard, she
will try to attain the same end by gentler and more
prudent means. 'You want no church and no sacraments,'
said the king to her, abruptly. The queen
of Navarre replied that, on the contrary, she wanted
both; and profiting by the opportunity for carrying
out her plan, she represented to her brother that it was
necessary to unite the whole of Christendom into one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">{138}</a></span>
body with the bishop of Rome at its head; and that
for this object, the priests should be brought to give
up voluntarily certain scholastic doctrines and superstitious
practices which stripped the ritual of the
Church of its primitive beauty. Then, taking from
her pocket a paper which Lefèvre had drawn up at
her request, during her stay in the south, she presented
it to the king: it was the confession of faith known
as the <i>Mass of Seven Points</i>. 'The priest will continue
to celebrate mass,' said Margaret to her brother,
'only it will always be a <i>public communion</i>; he will
not uplift the host; it will not be adored; priests
and people will communicate under both kinds; there
will be no commemorations of the Virgin or of the
Saints; the communion will be celebrated with ordinary
bread; the priest, after breaking and eating,
will distribute the remainder among the people.
Further, priests will have liberty to marry.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_236" id="Ref_236" href="#Foot_236">[236]</a></span>
When Francis had heard the seven points of his sister's
mass, he asked her what was left of the Roman mass?
Then the queen, taking him on his weak side—glory—represented
to him that by means of this compromise
he would unite all sects, and restore the Catholic
unity which had been broken for so many centuries.
Was it not the greatest honour to which a prince
could aspire?</p>

<p class="side">=THE QUEEN'S PREACHERS BEFORE FRANCIS.=</p>

<p>Francis I. appeared to be shaken, but yet he saw
great difficulties. The queen begged him to send for
Roussel and the two Augustine monks, Courault and
Berthaud: 'They will show you, I have no doubt,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">{139}</a></span>
she said, 'that the thing is practicable.' The king
was curious, says an historian, and accepted the offer.
The three evangelicals were taken from their prison
and conveyed to the Louvre, where the queen presented
them to her brother. She was full of joy: the
matter of the placards, which threatened to ruin everything,
might possibly be the means of saving everything.
She was deceived. When Francis talked with
her, it was no trouble to be like a kind brother with
a sister; but in the presence of the two friars and
Roussel he was a master. These persons displeased
him: the zeal with which they pointed out the errors
and abuses of the mass irritated him, and he sent
them back hurriedly to prison. Men more zealous
than they were, had already left their dungeons for
the scaffold.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XI.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">EXPIATIONS AND PROCESSIONS.<br />
 (<span class="smc">End of 1534 and Beginning of 1535.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">AN expiation was required for the purification of
France—solemn ceremonies, sacrifices, and the
stake. Nothing must be wanting to the expiatory
work.</p>

<p>Du Bourg, Milon, Poille, and their friends were
lying in prison, waiting for the day when they were
to appear before their judges. The poor paralytic
had remained as calm as in his father's shop: he was
even calmer. Formerly, when friends or kindred,
well accustomed to lift him, had taken him in their
arms, he had cried out with the pain he felt in every
limb. But now, in prison, he bore it all without
pain, and 'the roughest handling seemed tender.'
Receiving unknown strength from God, he was tranquil
and joyful under tribulation. That holy patience
spread peace in the hearts of his companions in misfortune.
'It is impossible to tell the consolation he
afforded them,' says the chronicler. They all found
themselves in a dark road which led to a cruel
death, but this poor man walked before them like
a torch, to guide and gladden them with its soft
light.</p>

<p>The day of trial arrived: it was the 10th of November,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">{141}</a></span>
a fortnight after the placards. Seven prisoners
were taken to the Châtelet: entering that ancient
building, where some remains of Cæsar's walls are
still to be seen, they appeared before the criminal
chamber, and the king's advocate in his scarlet robe
called for a severe sentence. The poor paralytic
could not be accused of running about the city to
fasten up the handbills; he was convicted all the
same of having some at his father's shop. Justice
was at once prompt and cruel. These virtuous men
were all condemned to have their property confiscated,
to do public penance, and to be burnt alive at different
places, and on different days. The court thought
that by spreading the punishments, they would
extend the terror more widely. The sentence was
confirmed by the parliament.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_237" id="Ref_237" href="#Foot_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=MARTYRDOM OF MILON.=</p>

<p>On the 13th November, three days after the
sentence, one of the turnkeys entered the cell of the
paralytic, and lifting him in his arms like a child, carried
him to a tumbril; the procession then took its way
towards the Grève. As he passed before his father's
house, Milon greeted it with a smile. He reached
the place of execution, where the stake had been prepared.
'Lower the flames,' said the officer in command:
'the sentence says he is to be burnt <i>at a slow
fire</i>.' This was a cruel prospect, still he uttered none
but words of peace. He knew that to believe and to
suffer was the life of a Christian; but he believed that
the grace of suffering was still more excellent than
the grace of faith. The enemies of the Reformation,
who surrounded the burning pile, listened to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">{142}</a></span>
martyr with surprise and respect. The evangelicals
were deeply moved, and exclaimed: 'Oh! how great
is the constancy of this witness to the Son of God,
both in his life and in his death!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_238" id="Ref_238" href="#Foot_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day it was the turn of Du Bourg, the
tradesman of the Rue St. Denis. The wealth he
had enjoyed during his life, the tears of his wife, the
solicitations of his friends, had been ineffectual to
save him. He was a man of decided character: when
he had posted up the placard, he had done so boldly,
although he knew that the act might cost him his life,
and he stepped into the tumbril with the same courage.
When he arrived in front of Notre Dame, he was
made to alight; a taper was put into his hand and a
cord round his neck, and he was then taken in front
of the fountain of the Innocents, in the Rue St. Denis,
quite near his house—he might have been seen from
the windows—after which his hand was cut off. The
hand that had fixed up the terrible protest against
Rome fell to the ground, but the man stood firm,
believing that 'if those who do battle under earthly
captains push forward unto the death, although they
know not what will be the issue, much more ought
Christians who are sure of victory to fight until the
end.' Du Bourg was taken to the Halles and there
burnt alive.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_239" id="Ref_239" href="#Foot_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=POILLE's SUFFERINGS AND COURAGE.=</p>

<p>On the 18th it was Poille's turn. That old disciple
of Briçonnet's showed as much firmness as his master
had shown weakness. The mournful procession took
its way towards the Faubourg St. Antoine, and halted
before the church of St. Catherine: it was here the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span>
stake had been prepared for the edification of the
believers of that district. Poille got down from the
cart, his features indicating peace and joy; in the
midst of the guard and of the surrounding crowd, he
thought only of his Saviour and his crown. 'My
Lord Jesus Christ,' he said, 'reigns in heaven, and
I am ready to fight for him on earth unto the last
drop of blood.' This confession of the truth at the
moment of punishment, exasperated the executioners.
'Wait a bit,' they said, 'we will stop your prating.'
They sprang upon him, opened his mouth, caught
hold of his tongue and bored a hole through it; they
then, with refined cruelty, made a slit in his cheek,
through which they drew the tongue, and fastened it
with an iron pin.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_240" id="Ref_240" href="#Foot_240">[240]</a></span>
Some cries were heard from the
crowd at this horrible spectacle: they proceeded from
the humble christians who had come to help the poor
bricklayer with their compassionate looks. Poille
spoke no more, but his eyes still announced the peace
which he enjoyed. He was burnt alive.</p>

<p>The punishments followed one another rapidly;
many other sentences had been delivered. On the
19th November, a printer who had reprinted Luther's
works, and a bookseller who had sold them, were
taken together to the Place Maubert. The poor
creatures had probably only thought it a good speculation;
they were however burnt at the stake. On
the 4th December a young clerk underwent the same
punishment in front of Notre Dame. On the following
day, a young illuminator, a native of Compiègne,
who worked in a shop near the Pont St. Michel, died on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">{144}</a></span>
the pile constructed at the foot of that bridge. Sometimes
it was deemed sufficient 'to flog the accused
naked,' to confiscate their property, and to banish them.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_241" id="Ref_241" href="#Foot_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=MORE FUGITIVES.=</p>

<p>The terror was universal. All who had kept up
any relations with the victims, or had occasionally
frequented the meetings, were uneasy and troubled.
There was great agitation in the evangelical houses:
flight seemed the only refuge, and many made preparations
for their departure.</p>

<p>Although we have spoken of the evangelical christians,
we have not named them all. There were some
whose profession, without being as public as that of
Du Bourg, De la Forge, and Milon, was yet quite as
sincere; many of them made themselves known at this
time. Of this number were several nobles: the Seigneur
of Roygnac and his wife, the Sieur of Roberval,
lieutenant to the marshal of La Marche; the Seigneur
of Fleuri in Brière, the Damoiselle Bayard, widow of
Councillor Porte—all took the road of exile deeply sorrowing.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_242" id="Ref_242" href="#Foot_242">[242]</a></span>
Trouble and alarm had penetrated even
into the offices of the State: many government
officers, Elouin du Lin, receiver to the parliament of
Rouen, and William Gay, receiver of Vernay, being
forced to choose between their livings and their consciences,
abandoned their posts and fled. Among the
fugitives were many who would not have been looked
for among the converted. Master Pierre Duval,
treasurer of the privy purse, touched by grace divine
in the midst of the revels which came under his management,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">{145}</a></span>
and his secretary, René, also a convert,
resolved to sacrifice those allurements of the world,
which vanish with life, and fly from the terrible wrath
of their master. Another Duval (John), probably of
the same family as Pierre, keeper of the lodge in the
forest of Boulogne, which served as a hunting rendezvous
for the court, had been reached by the Word
of God in the midst of his stags and falcons, just as
his cook, William Deschamps, had been. In like manner,
the Gospel had entered the Hôtel des Finances:
two clerks of the Treasury had begun to seek for the
<i>treasure in heaven</i>; their names were Claude Berberin
and Leon Jamet, of Sansay in Poitou. All these men
disappeared suddenly; some lay hid in remote villages
where they had friends; some went to Basle, others to
Strasburg. Jamet, a friend of Clement Marot (who
has addressed to him four of those burlesque epistles
known as <i>coq-à-l'âne</i>, and then in great vogue), went
to Italy, and took refuge at the court of the Duchess
René of Ferrara, who made him her secretary; and
Clement himself, who had already had more than one
encounter with the law, for his hatred of all constraint
and not for his faith, got frightened also, and accompanied
his friend beyond the Alps.</p>

<p>Side by side with these noblemen and servants of
the king were found more lowly men on every road
in France. The trades connected with typography
(printers, booksellers, and binders) formed the most
numerous contingent in these bands of fugitives.
The Reformation had gained many followers among
the masters and their workmen, and it was sufficient
to have printed, bound, or sold any of Luther's works,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span>
to be burnt alive. Master Simon Dubois, John Nicole,
the Balafré (the surname alone has come down to us)—all
of them printers, were in flight. Andrew Vincard,
the bookseller; Cholin and Jerome Denis, master-binders;
and one Barbe d'Orge, furbisher of books to
the court, had disappeared. Master goldsmiths, engravers;
John Le Feuvre, a cutter of block-books (he
may perhaps have cut certain designs representing
Christ and Antichrist, which had been distributed
along with the placards); a cooper, a carpenter, a
shoemaker; Girard Lenet, a painter; John Pinot, who
kept an inn, called the <i>Key</i>, on the Grève, notorious
for lodging Lutherans; the sister of the paralytic
Milon, who could not bear to remain in the city where
her brother had been burnt—all these were flying far from Paris.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_243" id="Ref_243" href="#Foot_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>Dauphiny was the province of France which had
contributed most to the evangelical brotherhood of
Paris. Master Thomas Berberin, Pasqualis, François,
Gaspard Charnel, and a young friar named Loys de
Laval, were all from Dauphiny, and returned hastily
to their picturesque home.</p>

<p class="side">=QUALITY OF THE FUGITIVES.=</p>

<p>Several other fugitives were monks: there were
brother Gratian and brother Richard, both Augustines;
brother Nicholas Marcel, a Celestine; the precentor
Jehannet, surnamed <i>the preacher</i>; and Master John
le Rentif, a secular priest, popularly known as the
<i>prêcheur de bracque</i>,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_244" id="Ref_244" href="#Foot_244">[244]</a></span>
so called, probably, because
having thrown off his sacerdotal gown, he preached in
breeches. In this fugitive flock there was one black
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
sheep, the famous doctor of divinity, Peter Caroli.
The Sorbonne had stopped his lectures at the college
of Cambray for having said: 'Nothing keeps us more
from the knowledge of God than images; and it is better
to give sixpence to the poor than to a priest for a mass.'
He left for Switzerland, where his presence was not very
highly appreciated. 'At that time also went out Caroli,'
says Beza, 'carrying with him the same spirit of ambition,
of contradiction, and of lewdness; a man whom
the spirit of God had not sent, but whom Satan had
brought to hinder the Lord's work.'</p>

<p>The colleges, also, where the evangelical light was
beginning to illuminate some of the masters and
pupils, supplied several fugitives. Professors on
whom the severity of parliament would have fallen,
rose up, bade farewell to their pupils, sorrowfully
went out of their studies, and disappeared. Master
John Renault, principal of a college at Tournay;
Master Mederic Sevin; Master Mathurin Cordier,
Calvin's mentor and friend, had quitted Paris in haste,
without taking leave of their colleagues. All classes
of society had furnished representatives to that body
which was hurrying from the capital along every
road. These noble Christians were often treated
ignominiously in their flight: many had pity on them,
but others insulted them. They were sometimes
obliged to hide themselves in stables or in the woods;
worn out by poverty and hunger, clothed in 'coarse
and dirty garments,' the better to elude their enemies;
but the peace of faith consoled them; they had been
unwilling to deny Christ; they had preferred, as
Calvin says, to renounce the life of this world to live
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
for ever in heaven, and the hope of a glorious resurrection
prevented them from fainting.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_245" id="Ref_245" href="#Foot_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>Margaret shed many tears in secret, and her silent
sorrow spoke eloquently to her brother. Presently
she risked a few prayers in behalf of her friends,
Roussel, Courault, and Berthaud. The king was still
irritated against them; but the love he felt for his
sister prevailed. He ordered the three doctors to be
taken out of prison and put in a convent: the dungeon
was changed to a cell, which was some slight relief;
and a sharp reprimand was given to each of them.
Roussel declared that he had no desire to break with
the Church, and retired to his abbey at Clairac.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_246" id="Ref_246" href="#Foot_246">[246]</a></span>
The feeble Berthaud, whom the punishments had frightened,
resumed his monastic dress without any reserve,
and died in the cloister; but the aged and intrepid
Courault remained firm. In vain did the king send
him back to the convent; in vain was the monk's
frock put on him, and a chaplet in his hands; he kept
silent, but at the first opportunity, some days only
after he had been sent to the cloister, he escaped, and,
although almost blind, took the road which Farel and
Calvin had already trodden, and reached Basle.</p>

<p class="side">=THE KING URGED TO PERSECUTE.=</p>

<p>This pardon, almost a disgrace to the king who
granted it, was the only and the last expression of
Francis's pity; after having given way to his sister,
he gave way to the courtiers, the cardinals, the Sorbonne,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span>
and parliament. The king's indulgence to the
three doctors served but to hasten the terrible persecutions
that were about to begin in France. The
people, especially at Paris, ignorant and superstitious,
and not imagining there could be any other religion
than that which they had been taught, were
astonished, disturbed, and uneasy at seeing the great
number of men and women won to the Gospel;
they were even touched by the serenity of the martyrs.
The chiefs of the ultramontane party, alarmed at
the agitation which was gradually spreading all over
the capital, and desirous of strengthening the faith
of the masses, began to solicit the king very earnestly.
They reminded him of the paper against the
mass, and called for severer punishments and more
striking satisfaction; they represented to him that
'the inhabitants of Paris were much disturbed by the
multitude of those who had gone astray from the faith.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_247" id="Ref_247" href="#Foot_247">[247]</a></span>
They seemed to see the waves of Luther's
doctrine impetuously advancing from Germany, and
on the point of breaking over France. At all risks a
dyke must be raised up sufficient to stop them. 'Sire,'
they said, 'transmit faithfully to your successors that
glorious title of eldest son of the Church which you
have received from your forefathers.... You know
how greedy the French mind is for novelties,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_248" id="Ref_248" href="#Foot_248">[248]</a></span>
and where may that lead us.... Give a public proof of
your attachment to the faith.' Francis had not forgotten
the placard fastened by night to the door of his
chamber, and that evangelical remonstrance seemed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">{150}</a></span>
is eyes a scandalous libel aimed at his majesty. Let
there be more burnings then.... But it is desirable
that they should be accompanied with unusual pomp.
By a royal law and constitution, it was ordered that
they should pray to the Almighty for the destruction
of heresy, and to that end there should be a solemn
procession and an expiatory sacrifice. Francis intended
to crown it with acts of barbarity.</p>

<p>All Paris was astir: the streets were hung with
drapery, <i>reposoirs</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_249" id="Ref_249" href="#Foot_249">[249]</a></span>
were erected, the most magnificent
dresses were preparing in the palace, and the victims
in the dungeons were counted. Francis had many
motives for giving a grand spectacle and accompanying
it with bloody interludes: public policy was not without
a share in them. He wished to silence the evil
tongues that were raving about his friendly relations
with Henry VIII. and the good grace with which he
had received the ambassador from the Grand Turk;
he wished to draw down the blessings of heaven upon
his arms; he wished to show that if he protected
sound learning, he despised fanatical writings, and detested
the anonymous libels circulated at the same
time as the placards, the <i>Seven Assaults</i>, the treatise
<i>Against the pope's traffickers</i>, and a host of others.
But the wrath that had seized him at seeing the criminal
handbill on his own door, particularly called
for a terrible revenge, and that without delay.</p>

<p>The 21st January, 1535, arrived. Early in the
morning a large crowd of citizens and people from the
surrounding country filled the streets; even the roofs
of the houses were covered with spectators. This curious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>
and agitated multitude still further augmented
the general emotion: many citizens of Paris had never
seen anything like it before. 'There was not the
smallest piece of wood or stone, jutting from the walls,
that was not occupied, provided there was room on it
for anybody, and the streets seemed paved with human
heads.' The innumerable concourse admired the tapestry
with which the houses were hung, the <i>reposoirs</i>,
the pictures filled with splendid mysteries. The people
gathered particularly before representations of the
<i>Holy Host</i>, of the <i>Jew</i> (probably the Wandering Jew),
'and others of very great singularity.' Before the
door of each house was a lighted torch, 'to do reverence
to the blessed sacrament and the holy relics.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_250" id="Ref_250" href="#Foot_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE PROCESSION OF RELICS.=</p>

<p>The procession began at six in the morning. First
came all the crosses and banners of the several
parishes; then followed the citizens, two and two,
each with a torch, and the four mendicant orders,
with the priests and canons of the city. Never had
so many relics been seen before. It was not only
living men who figured that day in the streets of the
capital to do honour to the mass; but there were
St. Philip, St. Marcel, St. Germain, St. Mery, St.
Honoré, St. Landry, St. Opportuna, St. Martin, St.
Magloire, and many others, who, whole or in part,
were paraded before the people. The crowd regarded
these ancient relics with devout admiration: 'There's
the body of the saint!... there are his shoes and
his breeches!'</p>

<p>Thus spoke the devout; but what effect did these
superstitions produce on enlightened men? What
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
would Calvin, in particular, have said, that great friend
of the worship in spirit and in truth paid to God alone?
He had left Paris some months since; but had he been
there still, at the moment of the procession, at De la
Forge's or any other house before which it passed,
what would have been his feelings? These we learn
from one of his writings, in which he treats of all
the relics displayed at this time before the Parisians.
This is the proper moment for showing what he thought
of these pretended relics of saints. Irony is a weapon
to be sparingly used in religious matters; we find it
employed, however, more than once in the Bible, for
instance where Elijah speaks to the prophets of Baal.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_251" id="Ref_251" href="#Foot_251">[251]</a></span>
Calvin might therefore make use of it; but he was
not naturally given to humour, and a profound seriousness
underlies his irony.</p>

<p>The holy bodies followed each other along the streets
of the capital. The admiration of the citizens increased
at every moment; they believed, as each relic passed
them, that they were looking at an object unique in
the world. 'The marvel is not so great,' said Calvin
subsequently. 'We have not only <i>one</i> body of each
of these saints, but we have <i>several</i>. There is one
body of St. Matthew at Rome, a second at Padua, and
a third at Treves. There is one of St. Lazarus at
Marseille, another at Autun, and a third at Avallon.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_252" id="Ref_252" href="#Foot_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon the canons of the Holy Chapel came in sight,
wearing their copes: no church in Christendom possessed
such treasures. 'Here is the Virgin's milk!'—'Indeed,'
said Calvin, 'there is not a petty town or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">{153}</a></span>
wretched convent where they do not show us this
milk. If the Virgin had been nursing all her life, she
would hardly have been able to supply such an abundance!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_253" id="Ref_253" href="#Foot_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>'There is our Lord's purple robe,' said the people;
'and the linen cloth he tied round him at the Last
Supper, and his swaddling clothes!'—'They would
do better,' said Calvin, 'to seek for Christ in his word,
his sacraments, and spiritual graces, than in his frock,
little shirt, and napkin.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_254" id="Ref_254" href="#Foot_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>'There is the crown of thorns!' was soon the cry.
The sensation produced by this venerated object was
all the greater, and the struggles of the people to get
near it all the stronger, because it had never before
been seen in the processions.—'It is no rarity,' said
Calvin. 'There are two of these crowns at Rome, one
at Vincennes, one at Bourges, one at Besançon, one at
Albi, one at Toulouse, one at Mâcon, one at Cléry,
one at St. Flour, one at St. Maximin, one at Noyon,
one at St. Salvador in Spain, one at St. Jago in Gallicia,
and many others in other places besides. To
make all these crowns and gather all these thorns,
they must have cut down a whole hedge.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_255" id="Ref_255" href="#Foot_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>'Here comes the true cross!' Again there was a
rushing and shouting, citizens and strangers crushing
one another,—'It is not the only one,' said the reformer,
'there is no petty town or paltry church where
they do not show you pieces; and if all were collected
together, there would be a load for a great barge, and
three hundred men could not carry it.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_256" id="Ref_256" href="#Foot_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>Next appeared a silver-gilt shrine, which attracted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>
universal attention: it contained the relics of St. Genevieve,
the patron saint of Paris; it was the last anchor
in the midst of the tempest, and was never brought
out except when France was in great peril. The
butchers of Paris had offered to carry this precious
amulet, and had prepared themselves for it by a
fast of several days: they moved along barefoot and
dressed in long shirts. Around this somewhat ferocious
group there was a continual movement. 'There
she is, the holy virgin of Nanterre,' was the cry. 'She
saved our forefathers from the fury of Attila, may she
save us from Luther's!' The people threw themselves
upon the relic: one wished to touch it with his cap,
another with his handkerchief, a third with the tip of
his finger, some even more daring tried to kiss it.
<i>Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the
way, when his wrath is kindled but a little.</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_257" id="Ref_257" href="#Foot_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>After the relics came a great number of cardinals,
archbishops, and bishops, with coped and mitred abbots.
Then, under a magnificent canopy, the four pillars of
which were borne by the king's three sons and the
Duke of Vendome, first prince of the blood, came the
host carried by the bishop of Paris, and adorned as if
it had been the Lord in person.</p>

<p class="side">=PENITENCE OF THE KING.=</p>

<p>Then appeared Francis I., without parade, bareheaded
and on foot, holding a lighted taper in his hand,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_258" id="Ref_258" href="#Foot_258">[258]</a></span>
like a penitent commissioned to expiate the
sacrilege of his people. At each <i>reposoir</i> he gave his
taper to the Cardinal of Lorraine, joined his hands
and knelt down, humbling himself, not for his adulteries,
his lies, or his false oaths—of these he did not
think-but for the audacity of those who did not like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span>
the mass. He was followed by the queen, the princes
and princesses, the foreign ambassadors and all the
court, the chancellor of France, the council, the parliament
in their scarlet robes, the university, the other
corporations, and the guard. All walked two and two,
'exhibiting every mark of extraordinary piety.' Each
man carried a lighted torch in profound silence. Spiritual
songs and funereal airs alone interrupted from
time to time the quiet of this gloomy and slow procession.</p>

<p>In this way it traversed the different quarters of the
capital, followed by an immense crowd of people, and
the inhabitants of each street, standing in front of
their houses, fell on their knees as the host went by.
The crowd was so great that bodies of archers, with
white staves in their hands, posted in every street,
could scarcely keep open a passage for the procession.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_259" id="Ref_259" href="#Foot_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>At length they arrived at the church of Notre
Dame; the sacrament was placed on the altar; mass
was sung by the Bishop of Paris, and all imaginable
homage was paid to the host in order to atone
for the insults offered to it by the placards. From
Notre Dame, the king and the princes returned to the
bishop's palace.</p>

<p>There are days of evil omen in history. There
is one especially that it is sufficient to name to fill
the mind with sorrow and mourning ... fatal date
which solemnly inaugurated in France the epoch of
persecution and martyrdom. On the <i>twenty-first of</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">{156}</a></span>
<i>January, 1535</i>, a king of France, surrounded by
his court and ministers, his parliament and clergy,
was about to devote to death with all due ceremony
the humble disciples of the Gospel. What the Valois
began, the Bourbons continued, and the most illustrious
of them carried out on a vast scale the system
of galleys and of burning piles. Alas! there are dates
which coincide in a striking and pitiless manner.
Four hundred and fifty-eight years later there was
another <i>twenty-first of January</i>. The simplest, the
meekest, the most generous of the Bourbons, condemned
by misguided men to suffer death, ascended
the scaffold erected in a public place in Paris; he
received the death-blow on the <i>twenty-first of January</i>,
1793. We do not presume to explain history; we do
not say that the innocent Louis XVI. paid the penalty
of his predecessor's crimes, and that God ordained the
expiation commanded by Francis I. to be followed by
another. But the coincidence of these two dates
startled us, and we could not avoid stopping to contemplate
them with a holy fear.</p>

<p class="side">=THE KING'S SPEECH.=</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ALL was not over: they had had the comedy (as
it appeared to some); they were now to have the
oratorical address, and then the tragedy. In order to
stifle the Reformation, something more was wanted
than relics, chanting, and images: blood must be shed.
But first of all there should be a speech from the
throne. We do not doubt the sincerity of the king
in his oratorical movements. The personal offence
that had been done to him, and the obstacles raised
by the placards to his political plans, most assuredly
engrossed him more than the cause of Catholicism;
but all this was mixed up in his mind, and he was
eloquent. The ambassadors,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_260" id="Ref_260" href="#Foot_260">[260]</a></span>
the court, the parliament,
the Bishop of Paris attended by the most distinguished
of his clergy, the rector of the university
with his principal doctors, the provost of the merchants,
the sheriffs, and a great number of the leading
officers and merchants of the city had received
orders to assemble after dinner in the bishop's great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">{158}</a></span>
hall. They expected a speech from the king, an
event of no frequent occurrence in those times, which
made them all the more impatient. Ere long Francis I.
entered: his countenance was serious, sad, and even
gloomy. His children, the other princes of the
blood, the cardinals and great officers of state surrounded
the throne, whence the king could be seen
and heard by the whole assembly. He took his seat and said:<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_261" id="Ref_261" href="#Foot_261">[261]</a></span>
'Messieurs, be not surprised if you do not
see in my face that look which is usual to me, and
that joy which animates me whenever I meet you.
Do not marvel if the tricks of eloquence are foreign
to my speech. I do not come to talk to you of myself;
we have to treat this day of an offence done to
the King of kings. It is proper that I should assume
another style and language, another look and countenance,
for I do not speak to you as a king and a
master speaks to his subjects and his servants, but as
being a subject and servant myself, and addressing
those who are fellow-servants with me of our common
King, of the Master of masters, who is God Almighty.
What honour, what reverence, what obedience do we
not owe to that great King!... What obligations does
not this kingdom, more than any other, owe to Him,
seeing that for thirteen or fourteen hundred years He
has maintained it in peace and tranquillity with its
friends, and in victory against its enemies! And if,
sometimes, for sins committed against His divine goodness,
He has wished to visit us with punishment in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">{159}</a></span>
temporal things, He has done it with so little severity,
that He has never exceeded the chastisement which a
kind and gracious father may use towards the faults of a
humble and obedient son. But as for spiritual things,
which touch the Holy Catholic faith, God has never
forsaken France so far as to let her stray ever so little
from it; and He has shown her this favour, that, by
common accord, she has enjoyed the privilege of being
the only power that has never nurtured monsters, and
which, above all others, bears the name and title of
Most Christian.... So much the more ought we to
feel grief and regret in our hearts, that there should
be at this time in France men so wicked and wretched
as to desire to soil that noble name,—men who have
disseminated damnable opinions, who have not only
assaulted the things which our great King desires to
be honoured, and acted so evilly that they do not leave
to others the power of doing worse, but have all at
once attacked Him in the holy sacrament of the altar.
People of low condition, and less learning, wicked
blasphemers, have used with regard to that sacrament,
terms rejected and abhorred by every other nation.
So that our realm, and even this good city of Paris,
which from the time when letters were transported
hither from Athens, has always shone in sound and
holy learning, might remain scandalised, and its light
be obscured.... Wherefore we have commanded that
severe punishment be inflicted on the delinquents, in
order that they may be an example to others, and prevent
them from falling into the like damnable opinions.
And we entreat the misguided ones to return into
the path of the Holy Catholic faith, in which I, who
am their king, with the spiritual prelates and temporal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">{160}</a></span>
princes, persevere.... Oh! the crime, the blasphemy,
the day of sorrow and disgrace! Why did it ever
dawn upon us?'</p>

<p>'There were few of all the company,' says the
chronicle, 'from whose eyes the king did not draw
tears.' After a few minutes' silence, interrupted by the
exclamations and sighs of the assembly, the king
resumed: 'It is at least a consolation that you share
my sorrow. What a disgrace it will be if we do not
extirpate these wicked creatures!... For this reason
I have summoned you to beg you to put out of your
hearts all opinions that may mislead you; to instruct
your children and your servants in the Christian doctrine
of the Catholic faith; and if you know any
person infected by this perverse sect, be he your
parent, brother, cousin, or connection, give information
against him. By concealing his misdeeds, you
will be partakers of that pestilent faction.' The
assembly gave numerous signs of assent; the king
saw the devotion, zeal, and affection visible in their
faces. 'I give thanks to God,' he resumed, 'that the
greatest, the most learned, and undoubtedly the
majority of my subjects, and especially in this good
city of Paris, are full of zeal for the Catholic religion.'
Then, says the chronicle, you might have seen the
faces of the spectators change in appearance, and give
signs of joy; acclamations prevented the sighs, and
sighs choked the acclamations. 'I warn you,' continued
the king, 'that I will have the said errors
expelled and driven from my kingdom, and will
excuse no one.' Then he exclaimed, says our historian,
with extreme anger: 'As true, Messieurs, as I am
your king, if I knew one of my own limbs spotted or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">{161}</a></span>
infected with this detestable rottenness, I would give
it you to cut off.... And further, if I saw one of
my children defiled by it, I would not spare him....
I would deliver him up myself, and would sacrifice
him to God.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_262" id="Ref_262" href="#Foot_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=EFFECTS OF THE ROYAL RHETORIC.=</p>

<p>At these words the king stopped: he was agitated
and wept. The spectators, affected by the sight of
this new Abraham, burst into tears. After the interruption
necessarily occasioned by this moving scene,
Du Bellay, bishop of Paris, and John Tronson, Lord
of Couldray on the Seine and prevost of the merchants,
approached, and kneeling before the king, thanked
him for his zeal—the first in the name of the clergy,
the other on behalf of the citizens—and swore to make
war against heresy. Thereupon all the spectators
exclaimed, with voices broken by sobbing: 'We will
live and die for the Catholic religion.' The author of
the <i>Chronicle of Francis I.</i>, who was probably present
in the assembly, dwells upon the emotion caused by
the monarch's address: 'We may clearly show by this,'
he says, 'that the speech of an eloquent and powerful
man may lead men's hearts at his will; for there was
not a man in all the company, whether native or
foreigner, who did not more than once change countenance,
according to the different affections the
words expressed.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_263" id="Ref_263" href="#Foot_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>Other emotions, those of anguish and terror, were
next to be aroused. After displaying his eloquence,
the king was about to display his cruelty. 'Francis,
always in extremes,' says a very catholic historian,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_264" id="Ref_264" href="#Foot_264">[264]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">{162}</a></span>
'did not disdain to pollute his eyes with a spectacle
full of barbarity and horror.' On the road between
St. Genevieve and the Louvre, two scaffolds had been
prepared, one at the Marksman's Cross in the Rue St.
Honoré, and the other at the Halles. Some of the
most excellent men that France possessed were about
to be burnt after suffering atrocious tortures. Altars,
galleries, and inscriptions had been placed on the
bridges and in the streets. On the bridge of Notre
Dame, around a fountain, surmounted by a large
crucifix, these lines were inscribed:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">

<div class="verse">Ipsi peribunt, tu autem permanebis. (Ps. cii.)</div>
<div class="verse">Inimicos ejus induam confusione. (Ps. cxxxii.)</div>
<div class="verse">Videbunt in quem transfixerunt. (John xix.)<span
     class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_265" id="Ref_265" href="#Foot_265">[265]</a></span></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A little farther on stood an altar with an invocation
to the Virgin and all the saints to give help, strength,
and grace against the attacks of the enemies of the
host. In other places were four stanzas in French,
each of which ended with this line:</p>

<p class="center small">France florit sur toutes nations.<span
   class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_266" id="Ref_266" href="#Foot_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>The king with his family, the nobles, and the rest of
the procession, having resumed his march, made his
first halt at the Marksman's Cross. Morin, the cruel
lieutenant-criminal, then brought forward three evangelical
christians destined to be burnt 'to appease
the wrath of God.' They were the excellent Valeton,
receiver of Nantes; Master Nicholas, clerk to the
registrar of the Châtelet, and another.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_267" id="Ref_267" href="#Foot_267">[267]</a></span>
The people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">{163}</a></span>
were so excited by the procession, and by the cries
raised in every quarter, and even by the throne,
against the reformers, that, when the martyrs appeared,
they rushed furiously upon them to snatch
them from the hangman's hands, and tear them
to pieces. The guard drove them back, and the disciples
of the Gospel were preserved for a more
frightful death.</p>

<p class="side">=THE STRAPPADO.=</p>

<p>The first who came forward was that brave man
and respectable Christian, Nicholas Valeton, who had
always 'kept good company.' The king had been
struck with the circumstance of the hiding of his books,
and ordered them to be burnt with him. Valeton
stood in front of the pile. With a sort of refined
cruelty, the wood with which he was to be burnt had
been taken from his own house; but this kind of
irony did not affect him. Another object attracted
his attention: it was a kind of gallows, formed of
two poles, one fixed firmly in the ground, the other
fastened to it cross-wise, one end of which was raised
at will by means of a cord fastened to the other. The
receiver looked calmly at this instrument of punishment,
to which they were about to fasten him to make
him soar into the air. Merely to burn these humble
Christians would have been too simple: the employment
of the <i>strappado</i> was to provide the people with
a more varied and more diverting spectacle. The
priests knowing that Valeton was a man of credit, and
that he was moreover rather a novice in heresy, desired
to gain him: they approached him and said: 'We have
the universal Church with us, out of it there is no
salvation; return to it, your faith is destroying you.'
This faithful Christian replied: 'I only believe in what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">{164}</a></span>
the prophets and the apostles formerly preached, and
what all the company of saints believed.' The attacks
were renewed in vain. 'My faith has a confidence in
God,' he said, 'which will resist all the powers of hell.'
The good people who were scattered among the
crowd admired his firmness,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_268" id="Ref_268" href="#Foot_268">[268]</a></span>
and the thought that he
left a bereaved wife behind him touched many a heart.</p>

<p>The punishment began. The hangman bound his
hands which he fastened to the end of the strappado;
the sufferer was then raised in the air, his arms alone
sustaining the whole weight of his body. The pile
over which he was suspended was then set alight, and
they proceeded to their cruel sport. The executioners
let the unhappy Valeton fall plump into the midst of
the flames; then, reversing their movements, they
raised the martyr into the air only to let him fall
again into the fire.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_269" id="Ref_269" href="#Foot_269">[269]</a></span>
'Make the wretches feel that,
they are dying,' a cruel pagan emperor had said; a
king of France carried out this order, and enjoyed it
with all his court, somewhat as savages do when they
burn their prisoners. After several turns at this atrocious
sport had amused the king, the priests, the nobles,
and the people, the flames caught hold of the
martyr from his feet to the cord that bound his hands,
the knot was burnt, and this upright witness to Christ
fell into the fire where his body was reduced to ashes.
This inhuman punishment was next applied by order
of the <i>most christian</i> king to the two other martyrs.
When the torture had lasted long enough, the executioner
cut the rope, if the fire had not consumed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">{165}</a></span>
it, in order that the victim might fall at last into
the flames.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_270" id="Ref_270" href="#Foot_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=TORTURES AT THE HALLES.=</p>

<p>Francis I. and his courtiers were not yet satisfied.
'To the Halles! to the Halles!' was the cry, and a
mass of curious people rushed thither, knowing that
the executioners had prepared a second entertainment
of a similar kind. The king and his train had scarcely
arrived, when they began to set the frightful strappado
in motion. A man known and highly esteemed
throughout the quarter, a rich fruit-merchant of the
Halles, had been fastened to it, and after him two
other evangelical Christians were served in the same
way. Francis and his court witnessed the convulsions
of the sufferers and could smell the stench of their
burning flesh. There were, no doubt, among the spectators
many individuals feeling for the sufferings of
others, but, surprising to say, there was not a sign of
compassion: the best of them suppressed the most
legitimate emotions. It was everybody's duty to
think that, as a jesuit says, 'the king wished to draw
down the blessing of heaven, by giving this signal
example of piety and zeal.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_271" id="Ref_271" href="#Foot_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>Francis returned satisfied to the Louvre: the courtiers
around him declared that the triumph of holy
Church was for ever secured in the kingdom of France.
But the people went still farther; they displayed a
cruel joy; the deaths of the heretics had furnished
them with an unknown enjoyment.... It was long
before the thirst for blood then awakened in them was
assuaged. They had just played the first act of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">{166}</a></span>
drama which was to be followed by others bloodier
still, the most notorious of which were the massacres
of St. Bartholomew, and, with a change of victims,
the massacres of September 1792. Certain enraptured
clerks thought that Francis I. surpassed Charles V.,
and exclaimed:</p>

<p class="center small">Cæsar edit edicta, Rex edit supplicia.<span
   class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_272" id="Ref_272" href="#Foot_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>Francis I. and his officers felt, however, some little
vexation: certain victims were wanting. They sought
everywhere for nobles, professors, priests, and industrials
suspected of protestantism, whom they could
not find. A few days after these executions, on the
25th January, the sound of the trumpet was heard
in all the cross-ways, and the common crier 'cited
seventy-three Lutherans to appear in person. In default
thereof, they were declared to be banished from
the kingdom of France, their goods confiscated, and
themselves condemned to be burnt.' These were the
fugitives whom we have already pointed out. None
of them appeared to the summons; but one of them wrote to the king:<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_273" id="Ref_273" href="#Foot_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">

<div class="verse">They call me Lutheran—a name</div>
<div class="verse">I have no right to bear.</div>
<div class="verse">Luther for me did not come down from heaven;</div>
<div class="verse">For me no Luther hung upon the cross</div>
<div class="verse">For all my sins; nor was I in his name</div>
<div class="verse">Baptised, but in the name of Him alone</div>

<div class="verse">The only name in heaven by which the world,</div>
<div class="verse">This wicked world, salvation can attain.</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the king was far from pardoning. Four days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">{167}</a></span>
after this publication (29th January) he issued an
edict, 'for the extirpation of the Lutheran sect which
has swarmed and is still swarming in the realm, with
orders to denounce its followers.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_274" id="Ref_274" href="#Foot_274">[274]</a></span>
At the same time
he addressed a circular letter to all the parliaments,
enjoining them to give 'aid and prisons' in order that
the heresy should be promptly extirpated.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_275" id="Ref_275" href="#Foot_275">[275]</a></span>
Lastly, the 'father of letters' issued an ordinance declaring
the <i>abolition of printing</i> all over France under pain of the gallows.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_276" id="Ref_276" href="#Foot_276">[276]</a></span>
This savage edict was not carried out:
it is, however, an index of the spirit by which the
enemies of the Reformation were animated.</p>

<p class="side">=PROCLAMATIONS AND PUNISHMENTS.=</p>

<p>Francis I., after having thus made some excursions
into the sphere of Charles V.—the <i>proclamations</i>,
returned into his own—the <i>punishments</i>. Du Bellay
interceded for the German protestants, and the king
sent them back to their own country; but, feeling his
hands free as regarded his own subjects, he sent fresh
victims to the stake. On the 16th February, Calvin's
friend, the rich and pious trader, La Forge, about
sixty years of age, was dragged in a tumbril to the
cemetery of St. John. 'He is a rich man,' said some
compassionate spectators; 'a good man that has given
away much in alms.' It did not matter: they burnt
him alive. Three days later a goldsmith and a painter
were mercifully (for Francis wished to see the arts
flourish) stripped and flogged, deprived of their goods,
and banished. Many Lutheran women were banished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">{168}</a></span>
also. On the 26th February, a young Italian, named
Loys de Medicis, perished in the flames at the end of
St. Michael's bridge; and his wife 'died in her bed of
grief at such infamy.' Shortly afterwards it was the
turn of a scholar, a native of Grenoble, who had posted
up some of the placards in the night. On the 13th
March, it was that of the chorister of the royal chapel
who in his rash zeal had fastened the protest to his
Majesty's door; he was burnt near the Louvre. On
the 5th May, a <i>procureur</i> and a tailor were dragged
on a hurdle to the porch of Notre Dame, whence they
were taken in a tumbril to the pig-market 'and there
hanged in chains,' which were not consumed so soon
as ropes. The same day, a shoemaker of Tournay,
banished from that city because he belonged to the
sect of Luther, died in a similar way, 'without repenting.'</p>

<p>About the same time two journeymen, natives of
Tours, and ribbon weavers, arrived in Paris 'from
Almayne,' bringing with them a Lutheran book.
'Landlord,' said one of them imprudently, 'take care
of this book while we go into town, and do not show
it to anybody.' The innkeeper whose curiosity was
thus aroused, turned the book round and round, tried
to read it, and at last, unable to hold out any longer,
went and showed it to a priest. The latter having
opened it, exclaimed: 'It is a damnable book!' The
landlord informed against the travellers; Morin had
the two friends arrested ... their tongues were cut
out, and they were burnt 'alive and contumacious.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_277" id="Ref_277" href="#Foot_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=LA GABORITE.=</p>

<p>Paris did not enjoy alone these cruel spectacles:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">{169}</a></span>
piles were kindled in many cities of France. A poor
girl, Mary Becaudelle, surnamed the Gaborite, had just
returned to Essarts in Vendée, her native place, after
being in service at Rochelle with a master who had
taught her the Gospel. A grey-friar happened to be
preaching in her little town and she went to hear him.
After the sermon, she said to him: 'Father, you do
not preach the Word of God,' and pointed it out to
him. Ashamed at being taken to task by a woman,
the friar, who was alone, resolved to get himself reprimanded
a second time, but before witnesses. The
plot was arranged. The friar having insulted the
doctrine of grace, the terrified Gaborite exclaimed:
'If you insult the Gospel, the wrath of God will be
against you.' She was condemned to the stake shortly
after, and endured her punishment with such patience
as to cause great admiration.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_278" id="Ref_278" href="#Foot_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>About the same time two or three men were keeping
watch, during the night, in the chapel of the Holy
Candle, at Arras in Artois. There was a candle
there, to which the devout used to sing hymns, because
the priests told them that it had been sent from
heaven and was never consumed. 'That is what we
will see,' said these evangelicals: Nicholas, surnamed
the <i>Penman</i>, 'a man of good sense and well taught in
holy learning,' Jean de Pois and Stephen Bourlet,
'who had both received much instruction from Nicholas.'
One day they took their station round the
candle, determined not to fall asleep. The substitution
generally effected by the adepts at night, while the
doors were closed, not having been made, on account
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">{170}</a></span>
of these inquisitive men, the perpetual candle came to
an end and went out, like any other candle. Then
Nicholas and his friends calling in 'the poor idolaters,'
showed them that there was nothing left of their
heaven-descended relic but the end of a burnt-out
wick. 'As the reward of their discovery these three
Christians received the crown of martyrdom together.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_279" id="Ref_279" href="#Foot_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>The persecution spared no one. It was often sufficient
for an enemy to accuse a person of having a
liking for the Gospel, when immediately the police
laid their hands on him. This was not the king's
intention: he had ordered that the judges should
inquire whether 'enmity, pique, or revenge gave rise
to false accusations;' but the magistrates were not so
scrupulous. The terror was universal. 'One sees
nothing in Paris,' said a catholic eye-witness, 'but
gibbets set up in various places, which surely terrify
the people of the said Paris, and those of other places
who also see gallowses and executions.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_280" id="Ref_280" href="#Foot_280">[280]</a></span>
Mezeray, while describing these events, says: 'But for ten that
were put to death, a hundred others sprang up from
their ashes.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_281" id="Ref_281" href="#Foot_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>The enemies of the Reformation, feeling that the
moment was decisive, redoubled their efforts to destroy
it. The French, save a certain numerous class submissive
to the clergy, were disposed to receive it.
They went to church, indeed, but the majority of
the population would willingly have embraced a religion
in which the priest did not interpose between
man and God. 'Alas!' said the more fervent, 'if the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">{171}</a></span>
king does not interfere to save the Church, all the
warmth of the French for the catholic religion will
soon be turned into ice.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_282" id="Ref_282" href="#Foot_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE KING'S MOTIVES.=</p>

<p>The king had a special motive in supporting
popery. A striking transformation was going on in
France as well as in other parts of Europe; limited
monarchy was changing into absolute monarchy.
Francis I. thought that men who set God above the
king, and died rather than invert the order of these
two powers, were very dangerous to despotism, and
he swore that, though he courted this religion without
his kingdom, he would crush it within. Alas! the
task was but too easy. Many were only superficially
gained. Nobles without high-mindedness or independence;
men of letters who jeered at obscurantism, but
who had not tasted the Gospel; ignorant and timid
crowds turned their backs upon the Word of God
when the flames of the burning piles rose into the air.</p>

<p class="side">=STURM'S LETTER TO MELANCHTHON.=</p>

<p>Terror spread through the ranks of the friends of
the Reformation. Sturm, who was deeply engaged
with literature and philosophy, broken-hearted at the
sight of all these woes, abandoned his labours. Many
of the martyrs were his friends, and had eaten at his
table. Dejected, disturbed in the midst of the lessons
he gave at the Royal College (which the celebrated
Ramus attended), having constantly before his eyes
the murderous flames which had reduced to ashes
those whom he loved, it seemed to him that barbarism
was about to extinguish the torch of learning, and
once more overrun society, hardly awakened from its
long sleep. He condemned the placards; in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">{172}</a></span>
opinion, the Reformation should make its way by a
learned exposition of its doctrines, and not by attacking
popular superstitions; but at the sight of the
punishments, he thought only of the victims. He
turned towards Germany where he had so many
friends, where there was possibly less decision than in
France, but a deeper and more inward faith; he thought
of Melanchthon, sat down at his desk, and as if he were
in the presence of that tender-hearted man, poured
all his sorrows into his bosom. 'If the letters which
I have sometimes written you on the affairs of this
country have been agreeable to you,' he said, 'if you
then desired that all should go well for good men,—oh!
what uneasiness, what anxiety, must not your
heart feel in this hour of furious tempests and extreme danger!<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_283" id="Ref_283" href="#Foot_283">[283]</a></span>
We were in the best, the finest position,
thanks to wise men; and now behold us, through the
advice of unskilful men, fallen into the greatest
calamity and supreme misery. I wrote you last year
that everything was going on well, and what hopes we
entertained from the king's equity. We congratulated
one another; but alas! extravagant men have
deprived us of those propitious times. One night in the
month of October, in a few moments, all over France,
and in every corner, they posted with their own hands
a placard concerning the ecclesiastical orders, the
mass, and the eucharist—one would think they were
rehearsing a tragedy<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_284" id="Ref_284" href="#Foot_284">[284]</a></span>—they
carried their audacity so
far as to fasten one even on the door of the king's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">{173}</a></span>
apartments, wishing by this means, as it would seem,
to cause certain and atrocious dangers. Since that
rash act, everything has been changed; the people are
troubled, the thoughts of many are filled with alarm,
the magistrates are irritated, the king is excited, and
frightful trials are going on. It must be acknowledged
that these imprudent men, if they were not the
cause, were at least the occasion of this. Only, if it
were possible for the judges to preserve a just mean!
Some, having been seized, have already undergone
their punishment; others, promptly providing for their
safety, have fled; innocent people have suffered the
chastisement of the guilty. Informers show themselves
publicly; any one may be both accuser and witness.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_285" id="Ref_285" href="#Foot_285">[285]</a></span>
These are not idle rumours that I write to you, Melanchthon;
be assured that I do not tell you all, and
that in what I write I do not employ the strong terms
that the terrible state of our affairs would require.
Already eighteen disciples of the Gospel have been
burnt, and the same danger threatens a still greater
number. Every day the danger spreads wider and wider.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_286" id="Ref_286" href="#Foot_286">[286]</a></span>
There is not a good man who does not fear
the calumnies of informers, and is not consumed
with grief at the sight of these horrible doings. Our
adversaries reign, and with all the more authority,
that they appear to be fighting in a just cause, and
to quell sedition. In the midst of these great and
numerous evils there is only one hope left—that the
people are beginning to be disgusted with such cruel
persecutions, and that the king blushes at last at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">{174}</a></span>
having thirsted for the blood of these unfortunate
men. The persecutors are instigated by violent
hatred and not by justice. If the king could but
know what kind of spirit animates these bloodthirsty
men, he would no doubt take better advice. And yet
we do not despair. God reigns, he will scatter all
these tempests, he will show us the port where we can
take refuge, he will give good men an asylum <i>where
they will dare speak their thoughts freely</i>.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_287" id="Ref_287" href="#Foot_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=LUTHER'S LETTER.=</p>

<p>This letter to Melanchthon is important in the
history of the Reformation. Liberty of speech and
of religious action is what protestantism claimed in
France; and in claiming these liberties for itself, it
secured them for all. We may imagine what an impression
this letter produced at Wittemberg. Melanchthon,
who received it, and even Luther himself,
blamed a certain excess of vivacity in the French
reformers; but, like Sturm, they recognised in them
disciples of the Divine Word. A few days after,
Luther writing to his friend Link, complained of the
evil times in which they lived, and especially of the
kings. 'With the exception of our prince (the Elector
of Saxony),' he said, 'there is not one whom I do not
suspect. You may understand by this language how
little love and zeal for the Word of God there is in
this world. For the present, sing, I pray you, this
psalm: <i>Expectans expectavi Dominum</i>, I waited patiently
for the Lord. It is through glory and disgrace,
through stumblings and strayings, through the righteous
and the wicked, through devils and angels, that
we come to Him who alone is good, alone is without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">{175}</a></span>
evil.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_288" id="Ref_288" href="#Foot_288">[288]</a></span>
Therefore, dear brother, I conjure you lend
no ear to any discourse, and have no other conversation
than what you have with <i>Him</i>. There are many
excellent people among men, but alas! they have less
patience than stern justice. God help us!... He
permits the devil to be strong, and how weak he makes
us! God puts us to the proof. To trust in a man,
were he even a prince, is not conformable with piety;
but to fear a man is shameful and even impious in a
Christian. May Christ, our life, our salvation, and
our glory, be with you and all yours!' Luther did
not name Francis I. in this letter, but it is well known
that of all princes the king of France was the one in
whom he had the least hope. He was not mistaken.</p>

<p>From this time Francis I. no longer showed the
same favour to learning, and especially to evangelical
learning. The excommunication launched against
Henry VIII., the schism which followed, the hope of
seeing Paul III. embroiled with Charles V., and other
motives besides, made him incline once more towards
Rome. But the placards were the principal cause of
this change. His wrath was unappeasable; he was
determined to abolish these new doctrines which were
paraded even on the gate of his palace. His indignation
broke out in the midst of his courtiers and
cardinals, bishops and councillors of parliament. Nay
more, he laid it even before the protestant princes of
Germany. Writing to them on the 15th February,
he said: 'The enemy of truth has stirred up certain
people who are not fools but madmen, and who have
incurred the guilt of sedition and other antichristian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">{176}</a></span>
actions. I am determined to crush these new doctrines;
and to check this disease, which leads to
frightful revolts, from spreading further. No one has
been spared whatever his country or his rank.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_289" id="Ref_289" href="#Foot_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>Such were the king's intentions. Protestantism,
and with it liberty, perished in France, but God was
mighty to raise them up again.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">CALVIN AT STRASBURG, WITH ERASMUS, AND AT BASLE.<br />
 (<span class="smc">Summer and Autumn, 1534.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHILE evangelical light seemed on the point
of extinction in France, one of her sons was
going to kindle a torch on the banks of the Rhine, and
afterwards on those of the Rhone, which would spread
its bright rays far and wide. Calvin had arrived at
Strasburg.</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN'S MISSION.=</p>

<p>He who was to be the true doctor of the Reformation,
its great captain, was then in search of
knowledge and of arms in order to teach and to fight:
this, as we have said, was the principal motive that
induced him to leave France. Like all noble characters
who have played an important part in history,
Calvin felt his vocation. He wished to labour at the
renewal of the Church; and in order to do this, he
must interpret Holy Scripture, and explain the body
of Christian doctrine. Hitherto he had preached the
Gospel like an ordinary believer; he had sown the
Word in a few insulated fields—at Orleans, Bourges,
Angoulême, Noyon, and Paris; now (without his
being conscious of it) a wider sphere was opening
before him; and he was going to learn the truth of
Christ's declaration: <i>the field is the world</i>. There was a
void space in Christendom, and God called him to fill it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">{178}</a></span>
He was to create the new, the living theology of modern
times. France, where scholasticism was the only
theological science, did not suffice him; he was going
towards Germany and Switzerland, where the love
and study of holy learning had arisen with power.
He saw from afar the lights that sparkled on the
banks of the Rhine, and on the plains of Saxony; and,
like a traveller who catches sight of a beacon in the
midst of the darkness, he hurried towards the places
whence those distant rays reached his eye. A child of
light, he was seeking the light.</p>

<p class="side">=THE COLLEGE AND MATTHEW ZELL.=</p>

<p>The free city of Strasburg possessed an intelligent
middle-class and wise magistrates. The revival of
learning had begun there in the fifteenth century;
shortly after Luther had published his theses at
Wittemberg, the echo of the great reformer's voice
was heard in that city of the Rhine. Elementary
schools were immediately established; monks who
had left their convents, and priests who were disenchanted
from their ancient superstitions, aided by pious
and devout artizans, undertook the education of the
children. A Latin college was founded in 1524,
where the canons of St. Thomas and other learned
Christians had begun a superior kind of instruction.
The new life then spreading through the Church,
circulated vigorously in Strasburg; it fermented in a
more especial manner in Capito, Bucer, and Hedio.
They conversed together, communicating to each
other the faith by which they were animated: it was
the spring sap pushing forth blossoms and giving
promise of fruit. Capito eloquently expounded the
books of the Old Testament; Bucer explained those
of the New with much wisdom; Hedio taught
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">{179}</a></span>
history and theology; Caselius, Hebrew; and Herlin,
the art of speaking. Professor John Sturm, then at
Paris, and the friend of Melanchthon, was about to be
put at the head of the educational work in his native city.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_290" id="Ref_290" href="#Foot_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a pious man at Strasburg, whose house
was known to all Christian travellers, and especially
to the exiles. He was Matthew Zell, pastor of the
church of St. Lawrence. When Calvin and Du
Tillet arrived in the capital of Alsace, they were in
great distress, having been robbed of their money as
we have seen. In this imperial city with all its
beautiful buildings, over which soars the magnificent
cathedral, they knew not where to go. The name of
Zell was familiar to Calvin, as well as his generous
hospitality; he knocked at his door, we are told, and
was cordially received. Calvin and Zell were very
different characters; but they appreciated each other,
and when the reformer was settled at Geneva, he did
not neglect to salute Zell in his letters to Bucer.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_291" id="Ref_291" href="#Foot_291">[291]</a></span>
Zell was a man of practical and conciliatory spirit,
and did not trouble himself much with theological
discussions; he cared only for his dear parishioners,
and was very popular. Bucer thought even too much
so. 'Matthew alone has the people with him,' he said.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_292" id="Ref_292" href="#Foot_292">[292]</a></span>
To this day his name is mentioned with affection
in Alsace.</p>

<p>As early as 1521 he preached the Gospel at Strasburg,
and with such unction and zeal, that an immense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">{180}</a></span>
crowd surrounded his pulpit. Being a man of
generous disposition, he boldly defended those who
were called heretics: 'Do you know why they are
attacked?' he said, 'because their enemies are afraid
that the indulgences and purgatory which they condemn
will bring them in no more money.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_293" id="Ref_293" href="#Foot_293">[293]</a></span>
Prosecuted by his bishop in 1523, he defended himself with spirit,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_294" id="Ref_294" href="#Foot_294">[294]</a></span>
and escaped with losing his post of confessor
to the prelate.</p>

<p class="side">=THE PASTOR'S WIFE.=</p>

<p>Calvin and Du Tillet soon noticed his partner,
Catherine Schulz, daughter of a carpenter in the city,
a clever, intelligent, active, firm woman, who had
managed to obtain the ascendant over everyone, and a
little too much so over her husband. The young
reformer saw in her one of the types of the Christian
woman, who cumbereth herself, who receiveth the
prophets honourably, but who, while doing good,
sometimes values herself more highly than she does others.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_295" id="Ref_295" href="#Foot_295">[295]</a></span>
Catherine's soul was troubled for a long
time; she doubted of her salvation. At last the voice
of Luther reached her, and brought her peace. 'He
persuades me so thoroughly of the ineffable goodness
of Jesus Christ,' she exclaimed, 'that I feel as if
I were dragged from the depths of hell, and transported
into the kingdom of heaven. Day and night
I will now tread the path of truth.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_296" id="Ref_296" href="#Foot_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>From that hour Catherine resolutely dedicated herself
to the practice of good works. The pastor of St.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">{181}</a></span>
Lawrence often had a large number of persecuted
christians seated round his table, and kept them in
his house for many weeks. One night he received
150 pious men from a little town of Brisgau, who,
having left their homes in the middle of the night,
had arrived in great distress at Strasburg. Catherine
found means to lodge fourscore of them in the parsonage,
and for a month had fifty or sixty of them
daily at her table. Even when her house was full,
she displayed the most unceasing activity abroad.
Caring neither for dress nor worldly recreations, the
pastor's wife visited the houses of the poor, nursed
the sick, wrapped the dead in their grave-clothes,
comforted the prisoners, and organised collections in
favour of the refugees. <i>She was never weary in well-doing.</i></p>

<p>In the midst of her zeal, however, she took too
much credit to herself. One day, recounting her
merits, she said: 'I have conscientiously assisted my
beloved Matthew in his ministry and in the management
of his house. I have loved the company of the
learned. I have embraced the interests of the Lord's
Church. Hence all the pastors and a great number
of distinguished men testify their affection and respect
for me.' Catherine did not know all that these
'distinguished men' thought of her; the colour would
have mounted to her cheeks could she have seen a
certain letter from Bucer to Blaurer, of the 16th
November 1533, in which that celebrated Strasburg
doctor complains of Zell's wife, 'who is so over head
and ears in love with herself;' or if that letter of the
3rd of February 1534 had been brought to her, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">{182}</a></span>
which her husband's friend wrote of her: 'Catherine,
like all of us, is too fond of herself.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_297" id="Ref_297" href="#Foot_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>At the time of Calvin's arrival in Strasburg, Bucer
was much tormented by Catherine's spirit of domination;
perhaps he should have understood that her
defects were but the exaggeration of her good qualities.
He complained of her influence over her husband:
'Matthew Zell is certainly pious,' he said, 'but ... he
is ruled by his wife.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_298" id="Ref_298" href="#Foot_298">[298]</a></span>
Another time he said: 'He
ought to preach faith more fully, more earnestly, but
... his wife drives him to care for nothing but works.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_299" id="Ref_299" href="#Foot_299">[299]</a></span>
The zealous Bucer, who was so often journeying
to reconcile Christians and Churches, could
not endure that Zell should think only of his parish,
should see nothing but his dear Strasburg, and
ascribed even that to Catherine. 'Oh,' said he, 'if
Matthew were but more zealous for the unity of the
Church!' And yet Bucer esteemed him highly, and
called him 'a God-seeking man, and of upright heart.'
Zell and Catherine were in those Reformation times
a Christian pair, worthy to figure in history, notwithstanding
their failings. Perhaps, however, Calvin
recollected Catherine's character when he reckoned
patience and gentleness among the foremost qualities
he should look for in a wife.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_300" id="Ref_300" href="#Foot_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>Calvin already knew by reputation the eminent
men who were living in Strasburg. He was never
tired of seeing and hearing them, both at their own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">{183}</a></span>
houses and at Matthew Zell's. He admired in Bucer,
with whom he had corresponded, and whom he afterwards
called his father,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_301" id="Ref_301" href="#Foot_301">[301]</a></span>
a noble heart, a peaceful
spirit, a penetrating mind, and an untiring activity.
Capito was not less attractive to him. Calvin knew
that, disgusted with the intrigues of the court, he had
left the elector of Mentz, and in 1532 had gone to
Strasburg in search of evangelical liberty, and from
that hour had watched with interest the movements
of the Gospel in France. He was, therefore, impatient
to see a man who, by the extent of his learning and
the nobility of his character, held the first rank in the
learned city where he resided; and fortunately Capito,
who went to Wisbaden towards the end of August
1534, was still at Strasburg when the reformer passed
through it. All these doctors joyfully saw France
bringing her tribute at last to the work of Christian instruction.
They were struck with Calvin's seriousness,
with the greatness of his character, the depth of his
thoughts, and the liveliness of his faith; and the
young doctor, for his part, drank in with delight that
perfume of learning and piety, which exhaled from the
conversation and life of these men of God.</p>

<p class="side">=DEFICIENCIES IN THE THEOLOGIANS.=</p>

<p>One thing, however, checked him: in his opinion
the Strasburg reformers observed too strict a middle
path, and sometimes sacrificed truth to prudence.
Calvin was troubled at this; by not breaking completely
with Rome, were they not preparing the way to
return to it? He was all the more alarmed, as the
young canon of Angoulême had a great inclination
for this middle way. Calvin, who would have desired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">{184}</a></span>
to put Du Tillet in connection with decided reformers,
saw the three doctors of Strasburg, and especially
Bucer, holding out their hands to Melanchthon to
reunite popery and the Reformation. Could he have
led him into a snare?... 'I find learning and piety in
Bucer and Capito,' he said one day, 'but they force
me to desire in them firmness and constancy. We
must be <i>liberal</i>, no doubt, but not so as to spend the
wealth of another. And what precautions ought we
not to take, when it is a question of spending God's
truth?... He did not give it us that we should
contract it in any way.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_302" id="Ref_302" href="#Foot_302">[302]</a></span>
True, these words are
found in a document of later date; but already the
wavering Du Tillet was approaching the gulf into
which he was to fall.</p>

<p>Calvin made up for his disappointments by devoting
himself lovingly to the French refugees at
Strasburg. He consoled them, succoured them, and
gave them very trusty counsel.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_303" id="Ref_303" href="#Foot_303">[303]</a></span>
To strengthen
his exiled fellow-countrymen was the work of his
whole life. 'We must be <i>strangers</i> in this world,'
he said, 'even if we do not quit the <i>nest</i>. But
blessed are those who, rather than fall away from the
faith, freely forsake their homes, and leave their earthly
comforts to dwell with Christ.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_304" id="Ref_304" href="#Foot_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>Calvin did not remain long at Strasburg. Did he
fear the influence of that city upon his friend? or did
he find too many occupations and disturbances which
prevented his giving all his time to the work to which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">{185}</a></span>
he wished to dedicate himself? I think so, but there
was something else. He understood that instead of
receiving knowledge from the hand of others, he must
personally work the mine of Scripture and dig up the
precious gems that it contained. He wished, like the
bee, to extract a store of the purest honey from the
abundance of the flowers of the divine Word. He
had had enough of travelling, of disagreements, of
struggles, and of persecution ... his soul longed for
solitude and quiet study. 'O God,' said he, 'hide
me in some obscure corner, where I may at last enjoy
the repose so long denied me.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_305" id="Ref_305" href="#Foot_305">[305]</a></span>
Calvin departed for Basle.</p>

<p class="side">=ERASMUS.=</p>

<p>Erasmus, as we know, had long resided in that city.
Calvin desired to see him. He was beyond all doubt
much more a man of compromises than Bucer; and
from timidity, rather than principle, he inclined to the
side of the papacy. He was, however, a great scholar;
had he not published the New Testament in Greek?
Having left Basle, at the moment of the triumph of
the Reformation there, he happened just at this time
to be at Friburg in Brisgau, on the road from Strasburg
to Switzerland. Could Calvin pass so near the
town where he lived who had '<i>laid the egg</i>' of the
Reformation, and not try to see him? A writer of
the sixteenth century has given an account of the
interview between these two men who—one in the
department of letters, the other in that of faith—were
the greatest personages of the day.</p>

<p>Bucer desired to accompany Calvin and introduce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">{186}</a></span>
him to Erasmus.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_306" id="Ref_306" href="#Foot_306">[306]</a></span>
The precaution was almost necessary:
the old doctor was <i>ratting</i>, wishing to die in
peace with Rome. Paul III. had hardly been proclaimed
pope, when he who had kindled the fire
offered his good services to him, in order to maintain
the faith and restore peace to the Church.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_307" id="Ref_307" href="#Foot_307">[307]</a></span>
His letter quite charmed the crafty pontiff. 'I know,'
Paul answered, 'how useful your excellent learning,
combined with your admirable eloquence, may be to
me in rescuing many minds from these new errors.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_308" id="Ref_308" href="#Foot_308">[308]</a></span>
The pope even had some idea of sending Erasmus
a cardinal's hat.</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN MEETS ERASMUS.=</p>

<p>Calvin had not chosen his time well, yet Erasmus
received him, though not without some little embarrassment.
The young reformer, impatient to hear the
oracle of the age, began to ask him numerous questions
on difficult points.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_309" id="Ref_309" href="#Foot_309">[309]</a></span>
Erasmus, fearing to commit
himself, was reserved, and gave only vague answers.
His interlocutor was not discouraged. Had not the
scholar of Rotterdam said that the only remedy for
the evils of the Church was the intervention of Christ himself?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_310" id="Ref_310" href="#Foot_310">[310]</a></span>
That was precisely Calvin's idea, and therefore
following it up, he explained his convictions with
considerable energy. Erasmus listened with astonishment.
He perceived at last that the young man
would not only go farther than himself but even than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">{187}</a></span>
Luther, and would wage a merciless war against all
human traditions. The scholar to whom the pope had
offered the Roman purple became alarmed; he looked
at Calvin with astonishment, put an end to the conversation,
and approaching Bucer, whispered in his
ear: <i>Video magnam pestem oriri in Ecclesia contra Ecclesiam</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_311" id="Ref_311" href="#Foot_311">[311]</a></span>
Erasmus broke with the French reformer
as he had broken with the German reformer. The
two visitors withdrew. We believe the account of
this interview to be authentic, in opposition to Bayle
who carries his sceptical spirit everywhere. Calvin
might have been proud of this opinion of Erasmus.
His censure might appear to him praise, and his
praise censure, as the poet says.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_312" id="Ref_312" href="#Foot_312">[312]</a></span>
Luther had said:
'O pope, I will be thy pestilence and death!' Calvin
and Du Tillet arrived at Basle.</p>

<p>That city possessed a university with distinguished
scholars, good theologians, and celebrated printers;
but Calvin did not knock at any of their doors. In a
bye-street there lived one Catherine Klein, a pious
woman, who took delight in serving God, and loved to
wash the feet of the saints, as the Gospel says. It
was her house the young doctor sought. Coming to
the banks of the Rhine, the two friends crossed the
famous bridge which unites Little Basle to the old
City, and knocked at this pious woman's door. Here
Calvin found 'the obscure corner' he had so longed for.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_313" id="Ref_313" href="#Foot_313">[313]</a></span>
Catherine received him with frankness and soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">{188}</a></span>
learnt the worth of the man she had in her house.
She was not one of those women who from vanity
'toy and coquet,' to use Calvin's own words;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_314" id="Ref_314" href="#Foot_314">[314]</a></span>
but of those who having the fear of God before their eyes,
are honest and chaste in their appearance.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_315" id="Ref_315" href="#Foot_315">[315]</a></span>
Distinguished by her virtues and piety, she loved to listen
to Calvin, and never grew weary of admiring the
beauty of his genius, the holiness of his life, the
integrity of his doctrines, and the zeal with which
he applied, day and night, to study.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_316" id="Ref_316" href="#Foot_316">[316]</a></span>
Calvin seemed like a lighted candle in her house; and thirty years
later, receiving as a lodger a man who was to be one
of the victims of the St. Bartholomew—Peter Ramus—this
estimable woman took pleasure in describing to
him the reformer's mode of life.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_317" id="Ref_317" href="#Foot_317">[317]</a></span>
The illustrious philosopher,
uniting his voice with that of the aged
Catherine, and standing in the very chamber that
Calvin had occupied, apostrophized the reformer, as
'the light of France, the light of the Christian Church
all over the world.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_318" id="Ref_318" href="#Foot_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>In the early part of his stay at Basle, Calvin
appears to have seen nobody but his hostess and his
inseparable friend Louis du Tillet. He avoided all
acquaintanceships that might have led to his being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">{189}</a></span>
recognised, and he went out but seldom.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_319" id="Ref_319" href="#Foot_319">[319]</a></span>
Sometimes, however, he and his friend would climb the
hills which rise above the Rhine, and contemplate the
magnificence of that calm and mighty river, whose
waters are ever flowing onwards, with nothing to
interrupt their majestic course.</p>

<p class="center small">Labitur et labetur in omne volubilis œvum.<span
   class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_320" id="Ref_320" href="#Foot_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=INWARD WORK IN CALVIN.=</p>

<p>It was not fear of persecution that led Calvin to hide
himself; he was in a free city. But he had need to put
himself out of the reach of the strange winds of doctrine
that were then rushing over the world, and of all
the sensations of one of the most troubled periods of
history. He wished to withdraw himself from earthly
noises, and hear only the voice of God and the music of
heaven. Rapid emotions, now sorrowful, now joyful,
continually repeated, as he had so often felt in Paris,
neutralised each other and left nothing in his heart.
He wished to fix his looks on high, and give the
thoughts which descended to him from heaven the
time to lay firm hold upon his mind, and become
transformed into a strong and unchangeable affection,
which would become the soul of his whole life. He
had already learnt much; but it was not sufficient
for him to learn, he must create: that was the vocation
he had received from his Master, and to that end
he must concentrate all the strength of his intelligence
and of his heart. When God desires to form the ripe
ear of corn, he proceeds slowly and silently, but powerfully.
The little seed is hardly thrown into the ground
when the manifold forces of different agents combine
to fecundate the germ. During the coolness of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">{190}</a></span>
night or the heat of the day, the earth imparts her
juices, the rain enriches it, and the sun-warms it....
Such was the inner process then going on in the reformer.
Divine and human forces were combining to
bring to maturity all the germs of beauty and strength
that God had deposited in his heart, will, and understanding,
and to render his genius capable of undertaking
and accomplishing a great work in the world.
Calvin felt that he needed silence and concentration.
Destined to become one of God's mightiest instruments
for his age and all ages to come, it was necessary
for him to live alone with God, that he should
have God in him, and that the divine warmth should so
melt and purify all his natural energies, as to fit him
for the accomplishment of his immense task. 'Ah!'
said he, without thinking of himself, 'God wishing to
publish his law by Moses, led him to Sinai and took
him into his heavenly closet.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_321" id="Ref_321" href="#Foot_321">[321]</a></span>
Many of God's ministers have, after Moses, been thus prepared for the
work of their office. Luther had been carried away
to the Wartburg: Basle was Calvin's Wartburg,
still more than Angoulême.</p>

<p>He had, however, one acquaintance, or rather an
intimate friend in that city. This was Nicholas Cop,
ex-rector of the university of Paris, and now a refugee
at Basle. How could Calvin, who had been the innocent
cause of his exile, remain long within the same
walls without seeing him? While preserving his incognito
with respect to the public, he called upon
his dear fellow-soldier, and the latter saw that pale
familiar face enter his room. The friends now visited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">{191}</a></span>
each other and conversed together; but mystery for
some time longer shrouded the person of the young
reformer.</p>

<p class="side">=GRYNÆUS AND CALVIN.=</p>

<p>One day, however, Calvin spoke to Cop of an eminent
man then in Basle. This was Simon Grynæus,
Melanchthon's schoolfellow, who in 1529 had escaped
with difficulty from the violent attacks of the papists
of Spire, and had been invited to Basle to take
Erasmus's place. 'Well versed in Latin, Greek,
philosophy, and mathematics,' said Melanchthon, 'he
possessed a mildness of temper that was never put out,
and an almost excessive bashfulness.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_322" id="Ref_322" href="#Foot_322">[322]</a></span>
And yet he has been compared 'to the splendour of the sun that
overpowers the light of the stars.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_323" id="Ref_323" href="#Foot_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>Calvin knew Grynæus by repute; he met him, and
was captivated by his amiable and gentle disposition.
Grynæus, on his side, loved Calvin, and the two
scholars often shut themselves up together in their
room. 'I remember well,' wrote Calvin to Grynæus in
after years, 'how we used to talk in private on the best
mode of interpreting Scripture.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_324" id="Ref_324" href="#Foot_324">[324]</a></span>—'The
chief merit in an interpreter,' said the Basle professor, 'is an easy
brevity without obscurity.' It is the rule Calvin
followed. At this time, under the direction of Grynæus,
he studied Hebrew literature more thoroughly.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_325" id="Ref_325" href="#Foot_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>Calvin's residence at Basle soon became known,
even to strangers, and the unseasonable visits which
interfered with his studies and which he so much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">{192}</a></span>
dreaded, began again. One day a total stranger
called upon him.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_326" id="Ref_326" href="#Foot_326">[326]</a></span>
He came (he said) on the part of
one Christopher Libertet, surnamed Fabri, a student of
Montpelier, who had quitted medicine for the ministry,
and whom we shall meet again in Switzerland as
Farel's fellow-labourer. 'Fabri has desired me to
inform you,' said the unknown, 'that he does not
entirely approve of certain passages in your book on the
<i>Immortality of the Soul</i>.' This message from a student,
delivered by a stranger, might have offended Calvin.
His work was a great success. The power of conviction
stamped on it, the weight of the proofs, the
force of the arguments drawn from Scripture, its
lucidity of style, its richness of thought, the glow of
light that shone round every word of the author—all
these things subjugated its readers. But the enthusiasm
of some of his friends did not blind the author
to the imperfections of his work. With touching
humility he answered Fabri, who had not long left
school: 'Far from being displeased at your opinion,
your simplicity and candour have delighted me much.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_327" id="Ref_327" href="#Foot_327">[327]</a></span>
My temper is not so crabbed as <i>to refuse to others
the liberty I enjoy myself</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_328" id="Ref_328" href="#Foot_328">[328]</a></span>
You must know, then,
that I have almost entirely re-written my book.' This
letter is signed <i>Martinus Lucianus</i>, the name probably
that Calvin went by at Basle. The date, <i>Basle, 11th
September</i> (the contents show that the year must be
1534), is an important mark in the reformer's life.</p>

<p>Visits were not the only troubles that disturbed Calvin's
solitude. His incognito had hardly ceased before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></span>
he was attacked by anxieties from every quarter. The
discords which broke out in France and Switzerland
filled him with sorrow. 'I exhort you with all my
soul, you and the brethren, to keep the peace,' he
wrote to Fabri. 'In order to maintain it, let us
make all the greater efforts, the more Satan endeavours
to destroy it. I have been filled with indignation
at hearing of the new troubles stirred up by a
man from whom I should have suspected nothing of
the sort. He has vomited the poison with which he
was swollen during a long period of dissimulation;
and after darting his sting, he has run away like a
viper.' Was this man Caroli?—I cannot say.</p>

<p class="side">=TRANSLATIONS OF THE BIBLE.=</p>

<p>In his retirement on the Wartburg, Luther had
translated the New Testament. Calvin engaged in a
similar task at Basle. On March 27, 1534, a translation
was published by Pierre de Wingle at Neuchâtel:
it was a small folio, printed in double columns,
and was from the pen of Lefèvre of Etaples, but
had undergone a revision with regard to certain
expressions which still retained a Romish colouring.
It would appear that this edition was suppressed,
either because it had been made without resorting to
the original texts, or because Wingle himself was dissatisfied with it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_329" id="Ref_329" href="#Foot_329">[329]</a></span>
He was soon to publish a more
perfect version, in which Calvin assisted while at
Basle. We shall have occasion to speak of this in
connection with Calvin's cousin, Olivetan, the principal
translator. Another work—which was to be the great
work of his life—soon occupied the young reformer.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CALVIN had not been long in Basle when dreadful
news arrived which deeply agitated the inhabitants
of that reformed city, and especially Calvin himself.
It was reported that in consequence of some
controversial placards which had been posted up in
Paris, and throughout France, the king's anger had
broken all bounds, that the evangelicals were persecuted,
that the Châtelet directed the inquisition ...
and that the burning piles were preparing. Cop, Du
Tillet, Calvin, and other refugees conversed about
these mournful events. Du Tillet blamed the violent
language of the placards; Calvin seems to have kept
silence on this point—at least in his famous epistle
to Francis I. he does not disavow the placards, which
it would have been wise to do, if he had decidedly
blamed them. Days and weeks went by in the midst
of continual uneasiness; the air seemed big with
storms, and terrible explosions from time to time
startled every compassionate heart.</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN'S PLEA FOR COMPASSION.=</p>

<p>At the end of November, Calvin heard of the successive
deaths of Berthelot, Du Bourg, Paille, and
several others whom he had known. How often he
had sat at Du Bourg's table, how often conversed
with the poor cripple!... Calvin, in his emotion, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">{195}</a></span>
greatly surprised at those who could find no tears for
such sorrows. 'Let us reject that mad philosophy,'
he said in after years, 'which would make men entirely
unfeeling that they may be wise. The stoics must have
been void of common sense, when they trampled on
the affections of man.... There are fanatics even now
who would like to introduce these dreams into the
Church, who ask for a heart of iron, who cannot support
one little tear, and yet, if anything happens to
them, against their will, they lament perpetually....
The affections which God has placed in human nature
are not more vicious of themselves than He who
gave them. Ought we not to rejoice in God's gifts?
Why, then, should we not be permitted to feel sorrow
when they are taken from us? Let believers lament,
therefore, when one of their relations or friends is
taken away by death, and let them be sad when the
Church is deprived of good men. Only, as we know
that life is given us in Christ Jesus, let our sorrow be
moderated by hope.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_330" id="Ref_330" href="#Foot_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>One day, probably in December or January, Calvin
saw an old man arrive: he was half blind, and felt his
way as he walked towards him. It was Courault, who,
liberated from prison by Margaret's influence, had
escaped from the convent where he had been shut up.
It was a great joy to the young doctor to see this venerable
Christian again, whose death three years later
was to overwhelm him with such deep distress. The
refugees surrounded Courault, and wanted to know the
terrible news from Paris. He had not witnessed the
punishments, but he could describe them, and cries of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
sorrow rose from every heart. Courault was soon
followed by other fugitives. For some weeks there
was a little repose; the sky was heavy and threatening,
but silent.</p>

<p>On a sudden the tempest burst out again, the bolts
fell furiously and consumed many other victims.
About the end of January 1535 the news of the
martyrdoms of the 21st of that month reached Basle.
Calvin's soul was perpetually agitated by these atrocious
persecutions. 'Alas!' he exclaimed, 'in France
they are burning many faithful and holy people!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_331" id="Ref_331" href="#Foot_331">[331]</a></span>
He saw them fastened to the <i>estrapade</i>, swinging in the
air, plunged into the flames, and then drawn out to be
plunged into them again.... 'With what furious rage
the enemies of God are transported,' he said; 'but
though horrible curses and execrable reproaches are
hurled upon the Christians from every side, they continue
to repose firmly on the grace of Jesus Christ,
having confidence that they will be safe even in death.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_332" id="Ref_332" href="#Foot_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>Calvin was not the only person to feel these keen
emotions. 'As gibbets were set up in various parts
of the kingdom,' says Mézeray, 'and <i>chambres ardentes</i>
were instituted, the Lutheran preachers and
those who had listened to them took flight, and in a
few months there were more than a hundred refugees
who carried their sorrows and their complaints to the
courts of the German princes.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_333" id="Ref_333" href="#Foot_333">[333]</a></span>
Their tales excited
great indignation in Germany. True, the martyrs were
often calumniated, but in many cities the refugees
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span>
from beyond the Rhine were able to refute the falsehoods
of their enemies. The true Christians were
not deceived, and they recognised the victims as their brethren.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_334" id="Ref_334" href="#Foot_334">[334]</a></span>
This was a consolation to the reformer.
'The news having spread to foreign nations,' he said,
'these burnings were counted very wicked by a
large number of Germans, and they felt great bitterness
against the authors of such tyranny.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_335" id="Ref_335" href="#Foot_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=OSWALD MYCONIUS.=</p>

<p>The 'bitterness' was still greater at Basle. Among
those who shared Calvin's sorrow was Oswald Myconius,
the friend of Zwingle, antistes or president of
the Church, for whom the reformer entertained an
affection that lasted all his life. He called him 'his
very excellent, most esteemed brother, and very respected friend.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_336" id="Ref_336" href="#Foot_336">[336]</a></span>
Myconius, as we have stated elsewhere,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_337" id="Ref_337" href="#Foot_337">[337]</a></span>
was a distinguished philosopher and pupil of
Erasmus and Glareanus: while residing at Zurich, he
had taught the classics, and among his pupils was
Thomas Plater; but the disastrous battle of Cappel
had made him renounce this duty. At the moment
when Plater, outstripping the fugitives, who were
hurrying from the fight, was about to enter the city,
he encountered Myconius, who was pacing backwards
and forwards before the gates, full of anguish at the
thought of the dangers incurred by Zwingle, Zurich,
and the Reformation.... The professor had hardly
caught sight of his pupil, when, running up to him,
he asked: 'Is Master Ulrich dead?' 'Alas! yes,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">{198}</a></span>
answered Plater. Myconius, struck to the heart, stood
motionless, and then, with profound sorrow, exclaimed:
'I can live at Zurich no longer.' Plater, who had
had nothing to eat for twenty-four hours, went home
with Myconius, who gave him food, and then sat
down by him, silent and oppressed by the weight of
his thoughts. At last Myconius took him into his
room, and said to him, with consternation: 'Where
must I go?'... The pastor of St. Alban's church at
Basle had also fallen on the mountain of Zug. 'Go
to Basle, and become minister there,' said Plater.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_338" id="Ref_338" href="#Foot_338">[338]</a></span>
Shortly after this the professor and his pupil set out
on foot for Basle, where they arrived after many adventures
and alarms.</p>

<p>A few days later Myconius was called upon to
preach the <i>Council Sermon</i>, which was delivered at six
in the morning. 'When I entered his room on the
morning of the appointed day,' says Plater, 'I found
him still in bed. "Father," said I, "get up; you have
your sermon to preach." "What! is it to-day?"
said Myconius, and jumped out of bed. "What shall
be the subject of my sermon? Tell me." "I cannot."
"I insist upon your giving me a subject." "Very
well; show whence our disaster proceeded, and why it
was inflicted on us." "Jot that down upon a piece of
paper." I obeyed, and then lent him my Testament,
in which he placed the memorandum I had just
written. He went into the pulpit, and spoke eloquently
before an audience of learned men, attracted there by
the desire to hear a man who had never preached
before. All were filled with wonder, and after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">{199}</a></span>
sermon I heard Doctor Simon Grynæus say to Doctor
Sulterus (who at that time belonged to us): "O Sulterus,
let us pray God for this man to stay among us,
for he may do much good." '<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_339" id="Ref_339" href="#Foot_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=SYMPATHY WITH CALVIN.=</p>

<p>Myconius was nominated pastor of St. Alban's, and
was soon after called to replace Œcolampadius as president
of the Church at Basle. He had entertained
some illusions with regard to Francis I. A Frenchman,
a strong partisan of that king, had persuaded him that
Francis was not ill-disposed towards the Gospel; that
if he dissembled his sentiments, it was only because
of the prelates of his kingdom; and that if he once
obtained the possessions in Italy which he coveted,
it would be seen that he had not much liking either
for the pope or the papists.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_340" id="Ref_340" href="#Foot_340">[340]</a></span>
Myconius was struck
with indignation and grief, when he heard of the
barbarous executions with which that prince had
feasted the eyes of the citizens of Paris. He could
sympathise all the more with Calvin, as, although a
man of mild and temperate disposition, he shared in
the decided and energetic opinions of the author of
the placards. 'Why sew new patches on so torn a
garment?' he said, speaking of popery. 'We should
never meet the dragon but to kill him.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_341" id="Ref_341" href="#Foot_341">[341]</a></span>
A great unity of sentiment drew Calvin and Myconius together
in the disastrous times of which we are speaking.
The burning stakes of Paris drove them farther from
Rome, and bound them closer to the Gospel.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">{200}</a></div>

<p>There were minds, however, upon which persecution
produced a very different effect. Amid all this
indignation and sorrow, Du Tillet remained shut up
in himself and silent. The gentleness of the Word of
God attracted him, but the bitterness of the cross
terrified him. He had quitted everything with joy,
believing that a general reform of the Church would
be carried out promptly; but when he saw a mortal
combat beginning between the Gospel and popery,
'he felt a deep emotion, he lost his rest,' as he tells
us himself, 'and suffered inexpressible trouble and
anguish of mind.' Each of the punishments at Paris
added to the doubts and agitation of that candid but
weak nature. He seemed to fear schism only, but the
prospect of persecution and reproach had some share
in his alarm. 'He did not understand,' as Calvin says,
'that while bearing the cross we keep Christ company,
so that all bitterness is sweetened.' He kept himself
apart, he passed days and nights filled with torture.
'I have been lonely, and without rest for the space of
three years and a half,' he wrote to his old friend in 1538.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_342" id="Ref_342" href="#Foot_342">[342]</a></span>
His intimacy with the reformer was changed,
and three years later he was to cause him a sorrow as
great, nay greater, no doubt, than that which Calvin
had felt when he heard of the deaths of the martyrs.</p>

<p>The intrigues of the agents of Francis I. began to
be attended with success. They displayed inconceivable
activity to mislead public opinion. They spoke,
wrote, and distributed everywhere 'certain little
books full of lies, in which it was said that the king
had behaved harshly to none but rebels, who desired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">{201}</a></span>
to disturb the State under the cloak of religion.'
Men, and often the best of men, are unhappily prone
to believe evil. Germany began to cool down; even at
Basle many people were deceived; and although they
did not believe all the calumnies circulated against
the martyrs, the impression still remained. 'If a
few sectarians have been punished,' said many good
men, 'they are anabaptists, who, far from taking the
Word of God for the rule of their faith, follow only
their own corrupt imaginations, and have at bottom
no other doctrine but a contempt of the higher powers.
We cannot defend the cause of a handful of seditious
people who desire to overthrow everything, even
political order.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_342a" id="Ref_342a" href="#Foot_342a">[342a]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=EFFECT OF THE MARTYRDOMS ON CALVIN.=</p>

<p>Shut up with his books in the room he occupied at
Catherine Klein's, Calvin thought day and night of
these cruel accusations, and his noble soul felt indignant
not only that the children of the heavenly Father
should be forced to suffer atrocious punishments, but
that it was attempted to defame their characters.
'These court practisers,' he said, 'load the holy
martyrs after their death with undeserved blame and
vile calumnies, and endeavour to hide the disgrace
of this shedding of innocent blood under cowardly
disguises. They thus put poor believers to death,
and no one is able to have compassion on them.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_343" id="Ref_343" href="#Foot_343">[343]</a></span>
The young doctor saw himself between two rivers
of blood—that of his brethren already immolated,
and that of other Christians who would certainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">{202}</a></span>
be immolated in their turn. He had not been able to
prevent the death of a Milon and a La Forge; but
he would at least try to turn away the sword that
threatened other lives. 'If I do not oppose it righteously
and to the best of my ability,' said Calvin, 'I shall
fairly be called cowardly and disloyal on account of
my silence.' He will speak, he will rush between the
executioners and their victims. A heavenly word rang
through his soul: <i>Open thy mouth for the dumb in the
cause of all such as are appointed to destruction</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_344" id="Ref_344" href="#Foot_344">[344]</a></span>
He therefore formed one of those resolutions which, in a
character such as his, are unalterable. 'I will obey
Him who speaks to me from on high,' he said. 'I
will reply to the wicked tales that are circulated
against my brethren; and as similar cruelties may
be practised against many other believers, I will endeavour
to touch foreign nations with some compassion
in their favour. Such was the reason,' he adds,
'which moved me to publish the <i>Institutes of the
Christian Religion</i>.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_345" id="Ref_345" href="#Foot_345">[345]</a></span>
Never had noble book so noble
an origin. Justin Martyr, Athenagoras, and Tertullian
had written their <i>Apologies</i> by the light of the
stakes of the second century; Calvin wrote his by the
light of those of the sixteenth. The publication of
the <i>Christian Institutes</i> was the pitiful cry of a compassionate
soul at the sight of those who were going
to the stake.</p>

<p class="side">=THEOLOGY RESTORED.=</p>

<p>Calvin had long meditated the great subject
which then absorbed him—the system of Christian
faith; and his book was to be the finest body of
doctrine ever possessed by the Church of Christ.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">{203}</a></span>
During four centuries, reckoning from the twelfth,
minds of the highest order had formulated abstract
systems, in which scholastic rationalism and ecclesiastical
authority were habitually combined; they had
wasted their strength in running after expositions,
contradictions, resolutions, conclusions, and interminable
<i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i>; theology was lost in an arid
wilderness. It was about to come out of it in order
to enter into new lands. But it was not a trifling
matter to make Christian science pass from death
to life, from darkness to light. It required an
awakened conscience, a heart thirsting for righteousness,
a high intelligence, and a powerful will boldly
to break through all the <i>chains</i>,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_346" id="Ref_346" href="#Foot_346">[346]</a></span>
to scatter to the
winds the <i>sentences</i> and the <i>sums</i> which the schoolmen
had painfully woven out of their brains or out of
traditions that were often impure, and to set up in
their place the living rock of the heavenly Word on
which the temple of God is to be built.</p>

<p>Calvin was the man called to this work. Until his
time, dogmatics, when passing from one period to another,
had always advanced in the same direction, from
abstraction to abstraction. But suddenly the course
was changed; Calvin refused to tread the accustomed
road. Instead of advancing in the way of the schoolmen
towards new developements of a more refined
intellectualism, he turned eagerly backwards, he heard
the voice of conscience, he felt the wants of the heart,
he ran whither alone they can be satisfied, he traversed
fifteen centuries. He went to the gospel springs, and
there collecting in a golden cap the pure and living
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">{204}</a></span>
waters of divine revelation, presented them to the
nations to quench their thirst.</p>

<p>The Reformation was not simply a change in the
doctrine or in the manners or in the government of
the Church: it was a creation. The first century had
witnessed the first Christian creation, the fifteenth
century witnessed the second.</p>

<p>Luther, by the power of his faith, was the principal
organ of this new creation. Freeing himself from the
thick darkness that had hung over mankind for so
many centuries, he had with holy energy hurled his
lightnings and thunderbolts in every direction around
him, so that all the horizon was lighted up. Calvin
appeared; he gathered up these scattered flames, and
made them into an immense fire; and while the gleams
of the primitive creation of the Church had been confined
almost entirely within the limits of the Roman
world, the fires of the new creation are spreading to
the ends of the earth.</p>

<p>Calvin retired within himself to meditate on the
work to which God called him; he turned a deep
glance into those depths of Scripture which he had so
often sounded. Holding the torch of the Spirit, he
summoned before him the great Persons of the Christian
economy, not to make them figure, as the schoolmen
had done, in a learned fencing-match, but to elicit
from them the fundamental truths of faith, and
plant the golden columns of the temple of light and
life.</p>

<p class="side">=THE INSTITUTES.=</p>

<p>The <i>Institutes of the Christian Religion</i> is Calvin's
great achievement; it is Calvin himself, and we must
therefore describe it. History, indeed, generally narrates
the actions performed by the arm of the soldier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></span>
or the negociations of the diplomatist; but the work
that Calvin then accomplished, by spiritual force, far
exceeds in the importance of its consequences all that
has ever been done by the pens of the ablest statesmen
or the swords of the bravest warriors. Let us describe,
therefore, this 'action' of a nature apart. 'Curious
minds,' as Calvin calls them, will perhaps pass over
these pages: we regret it, but we must write them all
the same.</p>

<p>'The whole sum of wisdom,' said the great doctor
of modern times at the beginning of his work, 'is
that by knowing <i>God</i>, each of us knows <i>himself</i> also;
and these two facts are bound to each other by so
many ties, that it is not easy to discern which goes
before and produces the other.'</p>

<p>In fact, Calvin, when addressing man, shows him
first of all <i>God himself</i>—wonder of wonders!—<i>in
man</i>. 'God,' says he to man, 'has stamped in you a
knowledge of himself, and he continually refreshes this
memory in you, as if he poured it out drop by drop.
We have <i>a consciousness of divinity graven so deeply
on our minds</i>, that we cannot erase it. The rebellion
even of the wicked bears testimony of this, for while
combating madly to throw off the fear of God, that fear
remains inevitably clinging to them, as if it were in the
marrow of their bones.' But after ascribing to man
the exquisite privilege of bearing the name of God
within him, Calvin immediately brings a severe charge
against the human race. 'Alas! we shall hardly find
<i>one</i> in a hundred that cherishes this divine seed in
his heart. Some through curiosity fly away in vain
speculations; others vanish in foolish superstitions;
others, finally, deprive God of his office as judge and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">{206}</a></span>
governor, shut him up idle in heaven, and thus remain
without God in the world.... What is to be done?
Shall we toss and tumble continually, carried hither
and thither by many erroneous levities?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_347" id="Ref_347" href="#Foot_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>Calvin then takes man by the hand, and wishing
him to know the eternal mysteries, places him before
a vast spiritual mirror, the Holy Scriptures, where all
invisible things appear in their living reality. Thus
distinguishing himself from all the doctors of catholicism
who had spoken for ten centuries, he puts in the
fore-front, in an absolute manner, the full sufficiency
and sovereign authority of the Word of God.</p>

<p>'God,' said he, 'has opened his sacred mouth, to
make known that he is the God whom we should
adore. When a handsome book in well-formed
characters is set before those who have weak eyes, or
before decrepit old men, they can hardly read two
words consecutively; but if they take a magnifying
glass, forthwith they read everything distinctly. If
we wish to see clearly, let us take Holy Scripture:
without it we have but a confused and partial knowledge
of God in our minds; but that drives away all
obscurity in us, and shows us clearly God's heart.'</p>

<p>Already in the time of Calvin there were certain
doctors who would strip the Bible of its inspiration
and christianity of its supernaturalism. 'There are,
I know full well,' he said, 'despisers, and cavillers,
and mockers, who attack the Word, and if I had to
fight out this quarrel with them, it would not be
difficult for me to silence their cackling. But in
addition to all the proof that reason brings, there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">{207}</a></span>
one above all others. It is necessary that the same
Spirit which has spoken by the mouth of the prophets
should enter our hearts, that he should touch them to
the quick, and convince them that the prophets have
faithfully declared what had been enjoined them from on high.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_348" id="Ref_348" href="#Foot_348">[348]</a></span>
The testimony of the Holy Ghost—that
is the proof of proofs.</p>

<p>Calvin then turns to man, the self-worshipper, who
puts himself in the place of God, and reveals to him
the sin that is in him. 'Come down now,' he says,
'come down and consider thyself. Learn to know this
sin, derived from Adam and dwelling in us, like a
glowing furnace, perpetually throwing out flames and
sparks, and the fire of which not only burns the senses,
but pollutes all that is most noble in our souls.'
There is no means by which man can escape of himself
from this wretchedness of his nature. 'If thou
pretendest to rise by thy own strength, thou standest
on the end of a reed ... that snaps immediately.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_349" id="Ref_349" href="#Foot_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Calvin shows man where his salvation is to be
found, and describes with grandeur the work of expiation.
'While our condemnation holds us surprised,
trembling, and startled before the judgment seat of
God, the penalty to which we were subject has been
laid on the innocent. All that can be imputed to us
in the sight of God is transferred upon Jesus Christ.
The divine founder of the Kingdom has suffered in
the place of the children of the Kingdom.... Our
peace can be found only in the terrors and agony of
Christ our Redeemer.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_350" id="Ref_350" href="#Foot_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">{208}</a></div>

<p>But how does this work, accomplished <i>out</i> of man, act
<i>in</i> man?... Such is the great question the Reformer
sets himself. Divine faith which lays hold of the
righteousness of Christ <i>upon the cross</i> gives birth at
the same moment to the holiness of Christ <i>in the heart</i>.
'Man has no sooner embraced the atonement with a
faith full of confidence,' he says, 'than he experiences
an unalterable peace in his conscience. He possesses
a spirit of adoption, which makes him call God <i>my
Father!</i> and which procures him a sweet and joyful
communion with the heavenly Father. Immediately
the least drop of faith is put into our souls we begin
to contemplate the face of God, kind and favourable
to us. True, we see it from afar, but it is with an undoubting
eye, and we know that there is no deception.'</p>

<p>A new question is here started. The young doctor
is asked: Is man saved by charity or without it? He
makes answer: 'There is no other faith which justifies
save that which is united with charity; but it is
not from charity that it derives the power to justify.
Faith justifies only because it puts us in communication
with the righteousness of Christ. Whosoever
confounds the two righteousnesses (that of man and
that of God) hinders poor souls from reposing on the
sole and pure mercy of God, plaits a crown of thorns
for Jesus Christ, and turns his sacrifice to ridicule.'</p>

<p>Here Calvin puts forward the grand idea which
characterises the Reformation effected by his teaching;
namely, <i>that it is only the new man which we
should value</i>. After insisting as much as any doctor
on the work that Christ does <i>without us</i>, he insists
more than any on the work Christ must do <i>within us</i>.
'I exalt to the highest degree,' he says, 'the conjunction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">{209}</a></span>
that we have with our Chief,—the dwelling
he makes in our hearts by faith,—the sacred union by
which we enjoy him. It is necessary that we should
perceive in our lives a melody and harmony between
the righteousness of God and the obedience of our
souls.'</p>

<p>But Calvin observed that many humble, timid christians
were distressed because they experienced only a
weak faith. These he consoles, and the images he
employs are picturesque: 'If any one, shut up in a
deep dungeon,' he says, 'received the light of the sun
obliquely and partially, through a high and narrow
window, he would not certainly have a sight of the full
sun, yet he would not fail to receive a certain quantity
of light and to enjoy its use. In the same way, though
we are shut up in the prison of this earthly body,
where much obscurity surrounds us on every side, if
we have <i>the least spark</i> of God's light, we are sufficiently
illuminated and may have a firm assurance.'</p>

<p>May not that flame be extinguished, ask christians
hesitatingly. 'No,' said Calvin, 'the light of faith is
never so extinct that there does not remain some
glimmer. The root of faith is never so torn from the
heart, that it does not remain fastened there, although
it seems to lean to this side or that.' 'Faith,' he exclaimed
(and he had often felt it), 'faith is an armed
man within us to resist the attacks of the evil one....
If we put faith in the front, she receives the blows and
wards them off. She may indeed be shaken, as a
stalworth soldier may be compelled by a violent blow
to step backwards. Her shield may receive damage
so as to lose its shape, but not be penetrated; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">{210}</a></span>
even in this extremity the shield deadens the blow,
and the weapon does not pierce to the heart.'</p>

<p>After consoling the timid and uplifting the wounded,
this extraordinary man, who speaks with the firmness
of one of the captains of the army of God,
exhorts the soldiers of Christ to be brave: 'When
St. John promises the victory to our faith, he does not
mean simply that it will be victorious in <i>one</i> battle, or
in <i>ten</i>, but in <i>all</i>. Be full of courage then. To fluctuate,
to vary, to be tossed to and fro; to doubt, to
vacillate, to be kept in suspense, and finally to despair
... that is not having confidence. We must have a
solid support on which we can rest. <i>God has said it</i>,
that is enough. Being under the safeguard of Christ,
we are in no danger of perishing.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_351" id="Ref_351" href="#Foot_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>Calvin turning to Rome seeks for the origin of its
errors and superstitions, and finds it in the pelagianism
with which it is tainted. Grace in all its fulness,—grace
from the first movement of regeneration until
the final accomplishment of salvation, was the keynote
of all Calvin's theology; and it is also the powerful
artillery with which he batters the Roman fortress.
Like St. Paul in the first century, like St. Augustine
in the fifth, Calvin is the <i>Doctor of grace</i> in the sixteenth.
This is one of his essential features. 'The
will of man,' he said, 'cannot of itself incline to good.
Such a movement, which is the beginning of our conversion
to God, Scripture entirely attributes to the
Holy Ghost. A doctrine not only useful, but sweet
and savoury through the fruit it bears; for those who
do not know themselves to be members of the peculiar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">{211}</a></span>
people of God, are in a continual trembling.... No
doubt the wicked find in it a matter to accuse and
cavil at, to disparage and ridicule ... but if we fear
their petulance, we must keep silence as to our faith,
for there is not a single article which they do not contaminate
with their blasphemies. Christ (he continues)
wishing to deliver us from all fear in the midst of so
many deadly assaults, has promised that those who
have been given him by his Father to keep, shall not
perish.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_352" id="Ref_352" href="#Foot_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>At this period Calvin hears a clamour raised against
him. He is accused of maintaining that God predestines
the wicked to evil, and he replies at once by
reprobating such an impious doctrine. 'These mockers
jabber against God,' he says, 'alleging that the wicked
are unjustly condemned, since they execute only what
God has determined.... Not so,' he exclaims; 'far
from having obeyed God's command, the wicked by
their lusts rebel against it as far as in them lies.
There must be no fencing with God; there must
be no saying, with Agamemnon in Homer, speaking
of evil: It is not <i>I who am the cause</i>, but Jupiter
and Fate.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_353" id="Ref_353" href="#Foot_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>Calvin next hastens to show the fruits of faith:
'We have given the first rank to doctrine,' he said,
'but to be useful to us, it must <i>penetrate into the soul,
pass into the manners and regulate the actions of our
life</i>.... Since the Holy Ghost consecrates us to be
temples of God, we must take pains that the glory of
God fills the temple.... We know those babblers
who are content with having the gospel on their lips,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span>
whilst it ought to sink to the bottom of the soul, and
we detest their babbling.'</p>

<p>Calvin had carefully studied the condition of the
Church during the Middle Ages: what had he found
there?... The separation of religion and morality:
a government, official doctrines, ceremonies, but all
stripped of moral life. At that time religion was a
tree stretching its branches wide into the air, but
there was no sap flowing through them. To restore a
lively faith in religion, and through faith a holy morality
was the reformer's aim. He said: 'God <i>first impresses
on our hearts the love of righteousness</i>, to which
we are not inclined by nature; and then he gives us a
certain rule, which does not permit us to go astray.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_354" id="Ref_354" href="#Foot_354">[354]</a></span>
Accordingly, a morality, unknown for ages, became
not only in Geneva, but wherever Calvin's doctrine
penetrated, the distinctive feature of the Reformation.</p>

<p>An important thought, however, still absorbs him.
He wishes not only to effect certain reforms in certain
articles, but to constitute the Church. In Calvin's
estimation the Church is in an especial manner the
whole assembly of the children of God; but he acknowledges
also, as having a right to this name, the
visible assembly of those who, in different parts of the
world, profess to worship the Lord: 'A great multitude,
in which the children of God are, alas! but a
handful of unknown people, <i>like a few grains on the
threshing-floor under a great heap of straw</i>. Our rudeness,
our idleness, and the vanity of our minds require
external helps (he added), and for that reason God
has instituted pastors and teachers.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_355" id="Ref_355" href="#Foot_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">{213}</a></div>

<p class="side">=APPRECIATION OF THE INSTITUTES.=</p>

<p>That was a solemn time for Calvin, when in the
room he occupied at Catherine Klein's, he finished his
<i>Institutes</i>. In after years pious Christians entered
her house with respect, and one of them, Peter Ramus,
being there in 1568, five years after the reformer's
death, exclaimed with emotion: 'Here were kindled
the torches that shed so great a light! Here those
illustrious <i>Christian Institutes</i> were composed; and here
Calvin gave himself up wholly to heavenly vigils!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_356" id="Ref_356" href="#Foot_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Christian Institutes</i> in its earliest form was a
simple defence, explaining briefly <i>law</i>, <i>faith</i>, <i>prayer</i>,
<i>the sacraments</i>, <i>Christian liberty</i>, and the nature of
the <i>Church and State</i>. But the French refugees at
Geneva, and even distant protestants, continually solicited
Calvin to set forth the whole Christian doctrine
in his book; and accordingly it received numerous
additions.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_357" id="Ref_357" href="#Foot_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Christian Institutes</i> are a proof that christian
love prevailed in Calvin's mind: indeed, he wrote for
the justification of <i>believers, his brethren</i>. However,
by defending the reformed, he explained and justified
the Reformation itself. What are its principles? The
formative principle of faith and of the Church is, with
him as with Luther, the sovereign Word of God; but
he asserts it with more decision than his predecessor.
Calvin is anti-traditional: he will have nothing to do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">{214}</a></span>
with host, or font, or festivals and other ceremonies
preserved by Luther. He did not <i>reform</i> the Church,
he <i>re-formed</i> it; he created it anew. Zwingle also
was scriptural, as opposed to tradition; yet Calvin's
theology is different from his; that of the Zurich
doctor was specially exegetic, while that of the
Geneva doctor was specially dogmatic. If from the
formative principle we pass to that which theologians
call the material principle, namely, that which distinguishes
the nature and very essence of its doctrine,
we find that it is at heart the same in Luther and
Calvin—gratuitous salvation; but the former, clinging
to Christian <i>anthropology</i>, laid down as a fundamental
article, the justification by faith of the regenerate
man; whilst Calvin, clinging particularly to <i>theology</i>,
to the doctrine of God, proclaimed first of all, salvation
by the sovereignty of divine grace.</p>

<p>Calvin's polemics, in his <i>Institutes</i>, are essentially
positive. Like a master in the midst of artists, who
are endeavouring to draw the same picture, Calvin
traces his outline with a bold hand, distributes the
light and shade, and succeeds in making an admirable
work. And from that time his rivals have only to
look at it, to acknowledge the imperfections of their
own, with all their want of proportion and extravagance....
Calvin destroys what is ugly, but he first
creates the beautiful.</p>

<p>The <i>Institutes</i> were admired by the finest spirits of
the age. Montluc, bishop of Valence, called Calvin
the greatest theologian in the world. A French
writer of our day, who does not belong to the Reform,
but is a correct and profound thinker,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_358" id="Ref_358" href="#Foot_358">[358]</a></span>
has characterised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">{215}</a></span>
the <i>Institutes</i> 'as the first work of our times
which presents an orderly arrangement of materials,
with a composition thoroughly appropriate and exact;'
and has distinguished Calvin himself, 'as treating
in a masterly manner all the questions of Christian
philosophy, and as rivalling the most sublime writers
in his great thoughts on God, whose style (he adds)
has been equalled, but not surpassed, by Bossuet.'</p>

The successive additions are easily seen in the first volume of
Calvin's Works just published in Brunswick by three Strasburg divines,
MM. Baum, Cunitz, and Reuss. We there find the different editions of the
<i>Institutes</i>, and the passages peculiar to each are printed in
larger type. We refer to the <i>Synopsis</i> in six columns of the
editions of 1536-1539-1543/5-1550/54-1559, &amp;c. In its first form the
<i>Institutes</i> consisted of six chapters only; in the last, of
eighty, divided into four books. Our selections have been made from the
complete edition.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE object of the <i>Christian Institutes</i> was to make
known to Christendom, and particularly to the
protestants of Germany, the doctrines professed in
France by the men whom the king was putting to
death. But was that all he had to do? Calvin
thought he saw something more pressing still. His
representations, instead of passing through Germany,
might be addressed direct to the king. In his anguish
and solitary meditations, he had often asked himself
why he should not do it directly and publicly?...
It was no doubt a great enterprise for a persecuted
and almost unknown young man to address that
powerful monarch, who was mercilessly throwing his
best subjects into the flames. Calvin did not at first
entertain so bold a project. Later, he said to the
king: 'I thought of nothing less than writing things
to be laid before your Majesty.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_359" id="Ref_359" href="#Foot_359">[359]</a></span>
But the lamentable
spectacle presented by France was night and
day before his eyes. And knowing that the same
fate was hanging over the heads of all who desired
no other mediator but Christ, was it right for him to
be silent?</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">{217}</a></div>

<p>In truth, the glare of the burning piles was reappearing
in France. A pious husbandman of Bresse,
'much exercised in the word of God,' by name John
Cornon, was arrested in his native village in the month
of May and taken to Macon. When brought before
his judges, he spoke with such faith and courage, that
they were astonished and confounded. Accordingly
at the end of June, he was bound to a hurdle, dragged
to the place of execution, and there burnt alive.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_360" id="Ref_360" href="#Foot_360">[360]</a></span>
Shortly after this, one Dennis Brion, a man zealous
for the gospel, was put to death during 'the great
days' of Angers, in order to terrify the crowds who
flocked thither from all parts for these festivals.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_361" id="Ref_361" href="#Foot_361">[361]</a></span>
The flames which burnt these pious confessors might
perhaps shortly burn other men of God, whom Calvin
desired to save at any cost. He therefore determined
to write to the king, dedicating his book to
him.... A bold step!</p>

<p class="side">=LETTER TO THE KING.=</p>

<p>'Sire,' he said, 'you are yourself a witness by what
false calumnies our doctrine is everywhere defamed.
Have you not been told that it tends to nothing else
but to ruin all kingdoms and governments, to disturb
the peace, to abolish all law, to confiscate lordships
and possessions, and, in a word, to throw everything
into confusion? And nevertheless you hear only the
least part of these outrages. Horrible stories are
circulated against us, for which, if they were true,
we should richly deserve to be hanged a thousand
times over.'</p>

<p>What Calvin undertook to do was not merely to
show that the evangelical doctrine of the Reformation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">{218}</a></span>
has the right to exist side by side with the Roman
Catholic doctrine. This philosophical and Christian
stand-point was not that of the sixteenth century.
If the evangelical doctrine has a right to exist, it is
(said Calvin, boldly) because it is the truth. He
desired to gain over both king and people to those
convictions, which in his opinion were alone capable of
enlightening and of saving them.</p>

<p>'Our defence,' he said, 'does not consist in disavowing
our doctrine, but in maintaining it to be
true. Truth deprives her adversaries of the right
to open their mouths against her. And for this
reason, Sire, I pray you to obtain full information of
a cause which hitherto has been treated with impetuous
fury rather than with judicial gravity....
Do not think that I am striving here in my own
private defence, in order to return to my native
country. Verily, I bear it such human affection as
is right, but things are now so arranged, that I am
not greatly distressed at being kept out of it.... No,
Sire, I undertake the common cause of all believers,
and even that of Christ himself, a cause now so rent
and trodden down in your kingdom, that it seems
desperate.... No doubt, Christ's truth is not lost and
scattered; but it is hidden away and buried, as if
deserving of all ignominy. The poor Church is driven
out by banishment, consumed by cruel deaths, and so
terrified by threats and terrors, that she dares not
utter a word. And yet the enemies of truth are not
satisfied. They insist with their accustomed fury on
beating down the wall which they have already
shaken, and in completing the ruin they have begun.'</p>

<p>Here Calvin asks if no one is taking up the defence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">{219}</a></span>
of these persecuted Christians.... He looks ...
alas! the evangelicals are silent, the queen of Navarre
scarcely raises her timid voice, and diplomatists
are persuading the Germans that the evangelicals of
France are fanatics and madmen ... every one
trembles.... 'Nobody,' he exclaims, 'nobody comes
forward to oppose this fury. If even any should
wish to appear to favour the truth, they confine themselves
to saying that we should in some way pardon
the <i>ignorance</i> ... the <i>impudence</i> of these simple folks.
Thus they treat God's most sure truth as <i>impudence</i>
and <i>ignorance</i>. Those whom our Lord has so esteemed
as to impart to them the secrets of his heavenly
wisdom, they call <i>simple folks</i>! who permit themselves
to be easily deceived, so ashamed are they of the
Gospel.'</p>

<p>Who then shall take the cause of truth in hand?...</p>

<p>'It is your business, Sire,' said Calvin to the king,
'not to avert either your ears or your heart from
so just a defence. A great matter is at stake. We
have to learn how God's glory shall be maintained on
earth, how his truth shall retain its honour, and how
Christ's kingdom shall remain in its integrity.... A
matter truly worthy of your ears, worthy of your
government and of your royal throne!... The
idea which makes a true king, is that the king
knows himself to be a true minister of God in the
management of his kingdom. A reign which has not
God's glory for its aim, is not a reign but a mere
brigandage.'</p>

<p>Calvin had hardly spoken thus when he seemed to
see Francis refusing to turn aside from his brilliant
fêtes to lend his ears to the meanest of his subjects.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">{220}</a></span>
The king listens to Montmorency, to Tournon ...
he hastens to meet the Duchess d'Etampes; he even
welcomes artists and men of letters; but these
miserable religionists ... never!</p>

<p>'Sire,' said Calvin, 'do not turn away in disdain of
our meanness. Verily, we confess that we are poor
despicable folks,—miserable sinners before God,
reviled and rejected before men.... Nay, if you
like it, we are the scum of the earth or anything more
worthless still, that can be named. Yes, we have
nothing left in which we can glory before God, except
his only mercy ... and nothing before men, except
our weakness!'</p>

<p>But the apologist immediately lifts up his head
with holy pride:</p>

<p>'Nevertheless,' he says, 'our doctrine must remain
exalted, invincible, and far above all the power and
glory of the world. For it is not ours, but that of the
living God and his Christ, whom God has made King
to rule from sea to sea, and from the rivers unto the
ends of the earth, ... and whose magnificence the
prophets have foretold, saying that he shall overthrow
kingdoms strong as iron and brass, and shining
like silver and gold.'</p>

<p>Here the advocate of his brethren hears an objection
from their enemies. He sees them clustering round
Francis, and incessantly repeating to him that <i>these
folks</i>, even while putting forward the Word of God, are
only its <i>perverse corruptors</i>.... 'Sire,' he continues,
'you can judge for yourself, by reading our confession
(the <i>Institutes</i>) to what an extent the reproach
is nothing but wicked calumny and brazen impudence.
What is more conformable with the christian faith,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">{221}</a></span>
than to acknowledge ourselves stripped of all virtue
to be clothed with God? empty of all good to be filled
with Him? the slaves of sin to be freed by Him?
blind, to have our sight restored by Him? lame, that
He may make us walk? weak, to be supported by
Him? in a word, to put off from us all manner of
glory, that He alone may be glorified?... Ah! we
do not read of men being blamed for drinking too
deeply at the fountain of living waters; on the
contrary, the prophet bitterly reproves those who
have hewed out broken cisterns that can hold no
water.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_362" id="Ref_362" href="#Foot_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>Calvin even attempted—and a hopeless attempt it
was—to touch the king's heart: 'Consider, Sire, all
parts of our cause. We are persecuted, some of us
are kept in prison, others are scourged, others forced
to do penance, others banished, others escape by flight....
We are in tribulation, insulted, treated cruelly,
looked upon as outlaws, and accursed.... And for
what?... Because we place our hope in the living
God, and believe that life everlasting is <i>to know the
only true God and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent</i>.'</p>

<p>Calvin knew very well, however, that the victory
would not be easy. He had seen the priests closely,
in the capital, in cities of second rank, and in the
country. He fancied he could hear the cries raised
by the curés in their parishes, and the monks in their
convents. Wishing, therefore, to enlighten the king,
he did so in a rather coarse manner, after the fashion
of the times. 'Why,' he asked, 'do our enemies fight
so stoutly and so sternly for the mass, purgatory, pilgrimages,
and such rubbish?' ... Because the belly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">{222}</a></span>
is their God, and the kitchen their religion. Because,
although some treat themselves delicately and others
starve upon crusts, they all eat out of the same pot
which, without these branches to warm them (the
mass, purgatory, &amp;c.) would not only grow cold, but
freeze entirely.'</p>

<p>Calvin was not ignorant however that the really
dangerous enemies of the Reformation were not those
priests and friars whom Erasmus and so many others
had often flagellated to the great delight of the king.
He imagined he saw haughty nobles, fanatical priests
and doctors entering the king's closet, and pouring
their perfidious accusations into his ear. 'I hear
them,' he says, 'they call our doctrine <i>new</i>.... Verily,
I have no doubt it is <i>new</i>, so far as they are concerned,
seeing that even Christ and his gospel are quite new
to them. But he who knows that this preaching of
St. Paul's is old, namely, that <i>Christ died for our sins
and was raised again for our justification</i>, finds nothing
new among us. True, it has long been hidden
and unknown, but the crime must be laid to the
wickedness of man; and now that by God's goodness
it is restored to us, it ought at least to be received
into its ancient authority.'</p>

<p>Here the enemies persist: they claim the old doctors
of the Church as being in their favour. This was the
strongest argument in the eyes of Francis, who affected
a certain respect for ancient christian literature.
Calvin was familiar with the writings of the doctors:
he had studied them night and day at Angoulême,
Paris, and Basle. 'The Fathers have been mistaken,
just like other men,' he said, 'but these good and
obedient sons (the Romish friars) adore the errors of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">{223}</a></span>
the Fathers, and put out of sight what they have said
aright, as if they had no other care but to pick out
the rubbish from among the gold.... And then
they attack us with loud clamours as despisers of the
Ancients. Far from despising them, we could prove
from their testimony the greater part of what we are
now saying. But those holy persons often differ from
each other and sometimes contradict themselves. They
ought not to tyrannise over us. It is Christ alone
whom we must obey wholly and without exception.
Why do not our adversaries take the Apostles for
their Fathers, since it is their landmarks and theirs
only that we are forbidden to remove? And if they
desire the landmarks of the Fathers to be observed,
why do they, whenever it suits their pleasure, overleap
them so audaciously?'</p>

<p>Further than this, Calvin makes use of these doctors;
he does not fear them, on the contrary, he
appeals to them. He calls them all up to make them
defile before the king and bear testimony against the
doctrines of Rome.</p>

<p>'It was a Father, Epiphanius, who said that it was
a horrible abomination to see an image of Christ or
of any saint in a christian temple.</p>

<p>'It was a Father, Pope Gelasius, who said that the
substance of the bread and wine dwells in the sacrament
of the Holy Supper, as the human nature dwells
in our Lord Jesus Christ, united to his divine essence.</p>

<p>'It was a Father, Augustine, who called it a rash
theory to assert any doctrine without the clear
testimony of Scripture.</p>

<p>'It was a Father, Paphnutius, who maintained that
the ministers of the Church ought not to be forbidden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">{224}</a></span>
to marry, and that chastity consisted in having a
lawful wife.</p>

<p>'It was a Father, Augustine, who contended that
the Church ought not to be preferred to Christ,
because whilst ecclesiastical judges, being men, may
be mistaken, Christ always judges righteously.... Ah!
if I wished to reckon up all the points in which the
Roman doctors reject the yoke of the Fathers, whose
obedient children they call themselves, months and
years would pass away in reading the long roll....
And then they reprove us for going beyond the
ancient boundaries!'</p>

<p>Calvin did not forget that he was speaking to a
prince. Struck with the condition of the world at
this important moment, when old superstition and
new doubts, old disorders and new immoralities,
ambitions, war, and desolations, were all conflicting
together, he called loudly for a remedy; and being convinced
that the Reformation alone could save society,
he exclaimed: 'Oceans of evil are deluging the land.
New plagues are ravaging the world. Everything
is falling into ruins. We must despair of human
affairs, or put them to rights, even if it be by violent
remedies. And yet men reject the remedy.... Ah!
God's everlasting truth alone ought to be listened to
in God's kingdom. Against it neither proscription,
nor lapse of years, nor ancient customs, nor any
compact whatever, avails anything.'</p>

<p>'But the Church,' say his adversaries. 'If we are
not the Church, where was it before you?' 'Alas!'
answered Calvin, 'how often has not the Church
suffered eclipse, been deformed and oppressed by wars,
seditions, and heresies.... Does not St. Hilary reprimand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">{225}</a></span>
those who, blinded by an unreasoning respect,
did not observe what sores were sometimes hidden
under a fair outside. You seek the Church of God
in the beauty of its buildings. But know you not
that there it is that Antichrist will set up his throne?
Mountains, woods, and lakes, prisons, wildernesses,
and caves—these are to me safer and more trustworthy;
for there prophesied the prophets, who had
withdrawn to them. God, seeing that men were
unwilling to obey the truth, permitted them to be
buried in deep darkness, and the form of a true
Church to be lost, while still preserving those who
belonged to it, hidden and scattered here and there.
If you are willing, Sire, to give up a part of your
leisure, and to read my writings ... you will see
clearly that what our adversaries call a Church is a
cruel gehenna, a slaughter-house of souls, a torch, a
ruin.'</p>

<p>Finally, the young doctor, knowing that the cardinals
were continually repeating to Francis I., 'See
what contentions, troubles, and disturbances the
preaching of this doctrine has brought with it,' gave
an answer to that vulgar accusation which is rather
striking and original: 'The Word of God,' he says,
'never comes forward without Satan's rousing himself
and fighting. A few years ago, when everything
was buried in darkness, this lord of the world played
with men as he list, and like a Sardanapalus, took his
pastime in peace. What could he do but sport and
jest, seeing that he was then in tranquil possession of
his kingdom? But since the light shining from on
high has chased away the darkness, the prince of this
world has suddenly thrown off his lethargy and taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">{226}</a></span>
up arms. First, he resorted to force in order to
oppress truth; then, to stratagem to obscure and
extinguish it. Oh! what perversity to accuse the
Word of God of the seditions stirred up against it
by fools and madmen!</p>

<p>'Ah! Sire, it is not us who stir up troubles, it is
those who resist the goodness of God. Is it likely
that we, whose mouths have never uttered a seditious
word; whose lives, while we lived under your sceptre,
were always simple and peaceful, should plot the
overthrowing of kingdoms?... Now, even that we
are expelled, we cease not to pray to God for the
prosperity of your reign.</p>

<p>'If there be any who, under colour of the gospel,
stir up tumults; if there be any who wish to
conceal their carnal licence by asserting the liberty
and grace of God: there are laws and punishments
ordained to purge these offences. But let not God's
gospel be blasphemed by the evil-doings of the
wicked.'</p>

<p>Calvin thus brings his letter to a conclusion: 'Sire,'
he said, 'I have set before you the iniquity of our
calumniators. I have desired to soften your heart,
to the end that you would give our cause a hearing.
I hope we shall be able to regain your favour, if you
should be pleased to read without anger this confession
which is our defence before your Majesty.
But if malevolent persons stop your ears; if the
accused have not an opportunity of defending themselves;
if impetuous furies, unrestrained by your
order, still exercise their cruelty by imprisonments
and by scourging, by tortures, mutilation, and the
stake ... verily, as sheep given up to slaughter, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">{227}</a></span>
shall be reduced to the last extremity. Yet even
then we shall possess our souls in patience, and shall
wait for the strong hand of the Lord. Doubtless, it
will be stretched forth in due season. It will appear
armed to deliver the poor from their afflictions, and
to punish the despisers who are now making merry
so boldly.</p>

<p>'May the Lord, the King of Kings, establish your
throne in righteousness and your seat in equity.'</p>

<p>Such was the noble and touching defence which a
young man of twenty-six addressed to the king of
France. He heard from afar the mournful cries of the
victims; and his soul being stirred with compassion
and indignation, he appeared as a suppliant before the
voluptuous prince who was putting them to death.</p>

<p>After finishing an address of such rare eloquence,
Calvin wrote the date—<i>Basle, 1st August, 1535</i>, and
then hastened to get the manuscript printed.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_363" id="Ref_363" href="#Foot_363">[363]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=PRINTING OF THE INSTITUTES.=</p>

<p>There was a house at Basle, on the heights of St.
Pierre, known by the sign of the <i>Black Bear</i>, where
there was a printing office belonging to Thomas
Plater, the Valaisan. Calvin often went there. Plater,
who had come to Basle with Myconius, as we have
seen, was at first a student, then a professor, and
finally 'the large sums gained by the printers,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_364" id="Ref_364" href="#Foot_364">[364]</a></span>
had given him the desire to become a printer also. When
Calvin was looking for a publisher for his <i>Institutes</i>,
the learned Grynæus recommended Plater to him.
The latter had the honour of printing that work,
and from that time Calvin kept up an occasional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">{228}</a></span>
intercourse with this singular man. When, some
years later, Felix Plater, the son of Thomas, who was
going to study medicine at Montpelier, passed through
Geneva, Calvin, to whom he brought a letter from his
father, called him <i>my Felix</i>, and received him with
much cordiality. 'I heard him preach on Sunday
morning,' said the young man in his memoirs; 'and
there was a great crowd of people.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_365" id="Ref_365" href="#Foot_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>It was, as we have said, in August 1535, that
Calvin handed Thomas Plater his epistle to Francis I.
to be printed. He had written it in French, and the
French edition bears the date of the 1st of August; but
he immediately translated it into Latin and printed
this version on the 23rd of the same month, which
is the date of the Latin edition.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_366" id="Ref_366" href="#Foot_366">[366]</a></span>
It is probable
that the epistle to Francis I. was printed in both
languages, and that the French text was sent to the
king, and the Latin to the German doctors, in September
1535.</p>

<p>Did Francis ever receive the letter? Did he listen
to this admirable apology? It is certain that his
heart was not softened. It is even possible that the
pleasures and policy of the monarch made him contemptuously
throw aside this appeal from one of the
poorest of his subjects. However, nothing prevents
us from believing that the king did read it, for the
style alone was worthy of a monarch's notice. Calvin's
friends, and even Calvin himself, hoped much from it.
'If the king would but read that excellent letter,' said
one of them, 'a mortal wound (or we are greatly mistaken)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">{229}</a></span>
would be inflicted on that harlot of Babylon.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_367" id="Ref_367" href="#Foot_367">[367]</a></span>
But was an ambitious, false-speaking, and libertine
king competent to understand the noble thoughts of
the reformer?</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN STARTS FOR ITALY.=</p>

<p>Calvin having published his appeal to Francis I.,
and perhaps ended the correction of the proofs of the
<i>Institutes</i>, thought of leaving Basle. These publications
would make a sensation; it would be known
that Catherine Klein's lodger was their author, and
Calvin would find himself courted and sought after....
'It is not my object to display myself and to
acquire fame,' he said.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_368" id="Ref_368" href="#Foot_368">[368]</a></span>
The fear of becoming famous
induced him, therefore, to get out of the way. He
had, however, other reasons, for quitting Basle: he felt
himself drawn towards Italy. Shortly after, on the
23rd August 1525, 'Calvin, having discharged his
debt to his country,' says Theodore Beza, set off with
Du Tillet, shrinking from eulogiums, thanks, and
approbation, just as another man would shrink from
threats and violence.</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN'S JOURNEY TO ITALY.=</p>

<p>The two friends rode side by side, but their
itinerary has not been preserved. There are, as every
one knows, many passes over the Alps, but that which
Calvin chose is as unknown to us as that of Hannibal—though
certainly not to be compared with it. It
has been supposed that the travellers took the road
along the shores of the lake of Geneva. If they passed
through Switzerland, and purposed crossing the St.
Bernard (as a manuscript of the 17th century states),
or the Simplon, or even Mount Cenis, Calvin must have
stood for the first time on the margin of those beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">{230}</a></span>
waters. Be that as it may, he was going to pass the
Alps. 'He had a wish,' as Theodore Beza tells us,
'to know the Duchess of Ferrara, a princess of
exemplary virtue.' But other motives impelled the
young reformer. He desired to see Italy: <i>Italia
salutanda</i>, as his friend tells us. This desire of
'saluting' Italy, so common to the inhabitants of the
rest of Europe from the time when the Roman
republic subjected the nations, and which exists still
in our days, Calvin felt like any other man.</p>

<p>But what did he go in search of!... Whilst he
was climbing the Alps and contemplating for the first
time their immense glaciers and eternal snows, what
thoughts filled his mind? There was some talk then
of a council; had that event, which seemed near at
hand, anything to do with his journey? As Vergeria
had gone from Italy to Germany, in order to
support the dominion of the pope, did Calvin
wish to go from Switzerland to Italy, in order to
assail it? Or attracted by the almost evangelical
reputation of Contarini, Sadolet, and other prelates,
did he long to converse with them? Did he feel the
necessity of seeing closely that papacy, with which he
was to deal all his life, and did he propose to study,
like Luther, its scandals and abuses? Did he wish to
carry back the gospel to that very country to which
Paul had taken it? Or was he only attracted by
classical recollections, by the learning and civilisation
of that illustrious peninsula? There was a little of
all these inducements, probably, in Calvin's wish.
He desired to visit the land of heroes, martyrs and
scholars, of Renée of Ferrara, and ... of the popes.
<i>Italia salutanda.</i> But his chief thought, we cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">{231}</a></span>
doubt, was to teach the principles of the Reformation,
to proclaim to Italy that Christ had come to destroy
sin, and had opened a way to the heavenly Father for
all who seek him. A catholic historian says that the
young reformer 'had conceived the design of withdrawing
from their obedience to the pope the people
nearest to his throne.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_369" id="Ref_369" href="#Foot_369">[369]</a></span>
There is some exaggeration
in this statement, but the substance is true.</p>

<p>Calvin crosses the torrents, ascends the sloping
valleys of the Alps, climbs yonder high mountains
which rise like impassable walls, and moves courageously
towards those Italian lands, where the men
of the Reformation are soon to be drowned in their
blood, where persecution certainly attends him, and
perhaps ... death. It matters not: onward he
goes. We might say, after an historian, that like
Mithridates, he desires to conquer Rome in Rome.</p>

<p>Let us leave him for a moment and turn towards
those countries whither he will come again, once more
crossing the Alps, on his escape from the prisons of
Italy. After wandering over the adjacent regions,
let us direct our steps towards that city which is
struggling so manfully with bishops and princes,
where courageous forerunners are about to prepare
the way for him, and which is to become, through the
torch that will be lighted there some day by the
hand of Calvin, the most powerful focus of the European
Reformation.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">STRUGGLES, political or religious, are the normal
state of society and the life of history. Their
necessity in a christian point of view is established by
the highest of authorities: <i>I am not come to bring peace
upon earth but the sword</i>, said the Saviour of men;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_370" id="Ref_370" href="#Foot_370">[370]</a></span>
and one of his disciples sixteen centuries later, developing
his master's words, added: 'As the greater
part of the world is hostile to the gospel, we cannot
confess Christ without encountering opposition and
hatred.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_371" id="Ref_371" href="#Foot_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=USES OF OPPOSITION.=</p>

<p>This thought would be saddening indeed, did not
experience and Scripture teach us that opposition is
often a means of developement; that the gifts of
God to man easily perish if nothing revives them;
that contradiction, resistance, and trial (thanks to the
care of divine providence) tend to civilise nations, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">{233}</a></span>
preserve to Christianity the truth, morality, and life
it has received from on high.</p>

<p>Whence proceeds this moral influence of contradiction?
A principle never evolves all that it contains,
says a school, except by coming in collision with a
contrary principle. In effect, the blow which a soldier
receives on the battle-field adds to his valour. The
inflexible obstinacy of Rome in upholding all abuses,
excited Luther to display with more energy the great
principles of the Reformation. And at Geneva, it
was because the huguenots had to contend perpetually
against a mean despotism in the State and an incorrigible
corruption in the Church, that their souls
groaned after liberty and a better religion.</p>

<p>Yet contradiction is not all that is necessary: there
must be reconciliation afterwards. The twofold opposition
of the huguenots (high-minded as it was)
against civil and religious despotism, would have
been ruined by its excess and would have ruined
Geneva, if it had not been moderated afterwards. It
was not good for the State that 'no one was willing to obey.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_372" id="Ref_372" href="#Foot_372">[372]</a></span>
It was not good for religion that opposition
to popery should consist in walking about the churches
during mass. Modern times needed, from their very
cradle, authority in the bosom of a free people, and
pure doctrine in the bosom of a living Church. God
gave both to Geneva, and he did so essentially through
the Reformation.</p>

<p>Care must be taken, however, that we go not too
far in the way of accommodation. The Reformation
must make no concessions to popery. Whenever it
has gone down that easy incline, it has left its calm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">{234}</a></span>
heights and fallen among quagmires which have endangered
its purity and existence.</p>

<p>But that was the conciliation which had to be carried
out in those times, and which ought still to be attempted
in the Christendom of our times. Between negative
protestantism and Roman-catholicism there is a middle
path. On the one hand the gospel ought to supply
this negative protestantism with what is deficient in
it, and on the other to take away from Romanism
whatever is erroneous in it. The huguenots, in
part at least, were transformed in the city of Calvin
by the great principles of the Reformation. It was
by the potent virtue of the gospel that this little city,
which had been only an Alpine burgh, was so marvellously
metamorphosed and became in Europe the
capital of a great opinion.</p>

<p>One circumstance, however, tended to compromise
its future. The Reform triumphed, but not without
losing strength, for the sword struck foul in the
struggle. 'If a man strive for mastery, he is not
crowned, except he strive lawfully.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_373" id="Ref_373" href="#Foot_373">[373]</a></span>
Calvin understood
better than the other reformers the spirituality
and independence of the Church; and yet giving way
to the general weakness, he had recourse to the secular
arm to maintain discipline, and was unable to prevent
the death of Servetus. That fatal stake did more
injury to truth than to falsehood. From that hour,
the doctrine lost its power, a stain soiled its flag, and
error seized the advantage of slipping into the ranks
of those who were summoned to combat her. Eminent
minds were seen abandoning the doctrines of the
Reformation, chiefly on account of the civil intolerance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">{235}</a></span>
by which they were defended. And thus a more
or less culpable stagnation followed the powerful
activity and glorious battles of the primitive days of
the Reformation. There were no more combats
round the expiatory cross, the eternal Word, the fall,
grace, and regeneration. No more struggles, and
therefore no more life. The christian fortress that
Calvin had erected having been assailed for two
centuries, shaken and dismantled, was on the point of
being razed to the ground; when fortunately the
struggles, entirely spiritual struggles, began again,
and religion was saved by them. When God, after
ploughing Europe in the early part of this century
with the terrible share of a conqueror, awoke it
from its long sleep, he remembered Geneva, and revived
there as in other places doctrine and life.
That city and all Christendom are now challenged
again to the old struggles, and also to new ones, in
which faith shall triumph over absolute thoroughgoing
negations, which not only deprive man of the
grace and adoption of the children of God, but deny
also the immateriality and immortality of the soul.</p>

<p class="side">=VAUD AND GENEVA.=</p>

<p>We shall not begin with the struggles of the
Reformation in Geneva, but with those which were
fought in a country beautifully situated between the
lakes and the mountains,—the Pays de Vaud. The
country was not large, its cities were not populous,
and the names of the men who struggled there do
not occupy an important place in the annals of nations.
Let us not forget, however, that there are two kinds
of history: the stage of one is a brilliant circle, of
the other a humble sphere. The actors in the former
are great personages, in the latter men of low esteem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">{236}</a></span>
in their own day. But is not the least sometimes the
greatest of these two kinds of history? Are not
events of small dimensions geometrically similar to
great ones? Have they not often a deeper moral
significance and a wider practical influence? With
truth it may be said of the struggles of Vaud and
Geneva: <i>Magnam causam in parvum locum concludi</i>,
a great cause is here confined within narrow limits.
The scenes, so modest and obscure, so full of decision
and life, which this history presents, have probably
done more to found the kingdom of truth and liberty,
than the disputes and wars of powerful potentates.
Such a thought as this has been expressed, even in
Paris. A contemporary writer, after tracing in his
history of the sixteenth century an outline of the
portentous future threatened by the intrigues of the
papacy, regains his courage with the words: <i>Europe
was saved by Geneva</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_374" id="Ref_374" href="#Foot_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>All the reformers have been men of strength; but
while Luther and Calvin have particularly contended
for the principles and doctrines of the Reformation,
others, like Knox and Farel, applying themselves to
the practice, have specially undertaken to win certain
countries or cities to the gospel. The men of God, in
all ages, have done both these things; but not one
of them has combined the two, like St. Paul. There
were two men in that apostle, the doctor and the
evangelist. Calvin was the great doctor of the sixteenth
century, and Farel the great evangelist: the
latter is one of the most remarkable figures in the
Reformation.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">{237}</a></div>

<p class="side">=FAREL.=</p>

<p>A catholic in his youth, fanatic in abstinence and
maceration, Farel had embraced salvation through
grace with all the living ardour of his soul, and from
that hour everything appeared to him under a new
face. His desire to enlighten his contemporaries was
intense, his heart intrepid, his zeal indefatigable, and
his ambition for God's glory without bounds. A difficulty
never stopped him; a reverse never discouraged
him; a sacrifice, even were it that of his life, never
alarmed him. He was not a great writer; in his works
we meet occasionally with disorder and prolixity; but
when he spoke he was almost without an equal. The
energetic language which transported his hearers had
been derived from the writings of the prophets and
apostles; his doctrine was sound, his proofs strong,
his expressions significative. Poets are made by
nature, orators by art, but preachers by the grace of
God; and Farel had the riches of nature, of art, and of grace.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_375" id="Ref_375" href="#Foot_375">[375]</a></span>
He never stopped to discuss idle or
frivolous questions, but aimed straight at the conscience,
and exhibited before those who listened to
him the treasures of wisdom, salvation, and life that
are found in the Redeemer. Full of love for truth
and hatred for falsehood, he inveighed energetically
against all human inventions. In his eyes the traditions
of popery were a gulf in which horrible darkness
reigned, and hence he laboured to extricate souls
from it and plant them in the soil of God's Word.
His manly eloquence, his lively apostrophes, his bold
remonstrances, his noble images, his action frank,
expressive, and sometimes threatening, his voice that
was often like thunder (as Beza tells us), and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">{238}</a></span>
fervent prayers, carried away his hearers. His sermon
was not a dissertation but an action, quite as much
as a battle is. Every time he went into the pulpit,
it was to do a work. Like a valiant soldier he was
always in front of the column to begin the attack,
and never refused battle. Sometimes the boldness of
his speech carried by storm the fortress he attacked;
sometimes he captivated souls by the divine grace he
offered them. He preached in market-places and in
churches, he announced Jesus Christ in the homes of
the poor and in the councils of nations. His life was
a series of battles and victories. Every time he went
forth, it was <i>conquering and to conquer</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_376" id="Ref_376" href="#Foot_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>It is very true, as we have said, that the cities
where he preached were not large capitals; but
Derbe, Lystra, and Berea where St. Paul preached,
were little towns like Orbe, Neuchâtel, and Geneva.
Most assuredly the Acts of the Reformation are not
the Acts of the Apostles; there is all the difference
between them which exists between the foundation of
Christianity and its reformation; but notwithstanding
the inferiority of the sixteenth century, the labours
of the reformers have a claim upon the interest of all
those who love to contemplate the humble origin of
the new destinies of mankind. Is there, after the
establishment of Christianity, anything greater than
its Reformation? Have not those weak movements
which began in the petty spheres in which Farel and
Calvin lived, gone on widening from age to age?
Are they not the origin of that new religious transformation
which, notwithstanding the declamations
and the triumphant cries of unbelievers, is now going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">{239}</a></span>
on in every nation of the earth? The source of the
Rhone is but a thread of water which would pass
unnoticed elsewhere; but the traveller who stands at
the foot of the huge glaciers which separate the mountains
of the Furka and the Grimsel, cannot look
unmoved at that little stream, which, issuing imperceptibly
from the earth, is to become a mighty river.
The thought of what it is to be inspires the friend of
nature and of history in this sublime solitude with
emotions more profound than those excited by its
copious and monotonous waters at Lyons, Beaucaire,
or Avignon. It is for this reason we dwell longer
upon the origin of the Reformation.</p>

<p class="side">=PREPARATIONS FOR VICTORY.=</p>

<p>A general who desires to capture an important
city, first makes sure of his position and occupies the
surrounding country: and so Farel, desirous of winning
Geneva to the gospel, first set about enlightening
the neighbouring people. His operations were
not strategic certainly; he thought only of converting
souls; and yet his labours in the Vaudois towns
and villages admirably prepared the way for his successes
among the huguenots. We have already seen
what he did at Aigle, Neuchâtel, and elsewhere;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_377" id="Ref_377" href="#Foot_377">[377]</a></span>
we must now follow him into other parts of that picturesque
country, enclosed between the pointed
citadels of the Alps and the undulating lines of
the Jura, whose waters flow—some by the lake of
Neuchâtel, the Aar and the Rhine to the North Sea,
others by the lake of Geneva and the Rhone to the
Mediterranean: a symbol of the spiritual waters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">{240}</a></span>
which, issuing from the same hills, were soon to bear
light and life to the peoples of the north and of the
south.</p>

<p class="side">=FABRI JOINS FAREL.=</p>

<p>Farel was inactive (a singular thing!) at the
moment when we are going to see him prepare
betimes for the conquest of Geneva. Wounded near
Neuchâtel by a riotous crowd, he had been placed in
a boat, and carried across the lake to Morat, as we
have said in a former work.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_378" id="Ref_378" href="#Foot_378">[378]</a></span>
His friends in that
town had welcomed him with emotion, and kept
watch around his bed. Condemned to repose, 'shivering
with cold, spitting blood,' and scarcely able to
speak, he was communing in silence with his God
when he saw a young Dauphinese of good appearance,
Christopher Fabri by name, enter his room. This
Frenchman, of whom we have already spoken, had
studied medicine at Montpelier, and there received
the first rays of the gospel. Having started for Paris,
in order to complete his studies in that city, he met
with some friends of the truth at Lyons, who told
him of all that was going on at Neuchâtel and its
vicinity. Fabri was greatly moved, and being a man
of lively, prompt, and decided character, he suddenly
changed his route, calling, and life, and instead of
going on to Paris turned his steps to Geneva, and
thence to Morat.</p>

<p>On arriving at that town, the student enquired
after Farel, and on presenting himself at the house,
was admitted into the room where the reformer was
lying. Modestly approaching the bed, he said to
him: 'I have forsaken everything, family, prospects,
and country, to fight at your side, Master William.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">{241}</a></span>
Here I am; do with me what seems good to you.'
Farel looked at him kindly, and ere long appreciated
the young man's lively affection and boundless devotion.
He saw that they both had the same faith, the
same Saviour. As he was unmarried, he looked upon
Fabri as a son whom God had sent him,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_379" id="Ref_379" href="#Foot_379">[379]</a></span>
and henceforward
had frequent Christian conversations with
him, in which he sought to train him for the ministry
of the gospel. Farel would have liked to keep him
always at his side; but he loved Jesus Christ more
than the tenderest son is beloved; and accordingly,
after a short but delightful intercourse he asked the
converted Dauphinese to go and preach the gospel at
Neuchâtel. Fabri, who had not expected so early a
separation, exclaimed with tears: 'O master, my
sorrow is greater to-day than when I left father and
mother, so sweet have been my conversations with
you!' He obeyed, however.</p>

<p>Farel was never content with sending others to
battle; he burned to return to it in person, and to
lead to the heavenly King, whose servant he was, all
the population which, enclosed between the Alps and
the Jura, spoke the language of his country. He
thought that if the intelligent people placed at the
gates of France were won over to the divine Word,
they would become a focus to cast the light of the
gospel into that kingdom, and an asylum where the
Christians persecuted by Francis I. might find a
refuge.</p>

<p>A town lying at the foot of the lower slopes of the
Jura attracted his thoughts during his solitary hours
at Morat: this was Orbe. The ancient city of Urba,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">{242}</a></span>
built, it is said, in the same century as Rome, was
situated on the Roman way that led from Italy to
Gaul. Being rebuilt later some little distance off,
the kings of the first race of France, as the people of
Orbe boasted, had taken up their residence there, as
if, immediately after crossing the Jura, they had exclaimed
at the ravishing prospect of the Alps: 'It is
enough! we will stop here.' A torrent issuing from
the lakes that are found in the high Jurassic valleys
plunges into the gigantic clefts of the mountain, and
after pursuing a subterranean and mysterious career,
reappears on the other slope, towards the plain, whence
descending from one fall to another, it gracefully sweeps
round the beautiful hill on which the town of Orbe is
situated, surrounded with vineyards, gardens, and
orchards, 'with all kinds of plants and good things.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_380" id="Ref_380" href="#Foot_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=FAREL PREACHES AT ORBE.=</p>

<p>A dealer in indulgences, attracted by this wealth,
was just at this time noisily selling his pardons for
every offence. Farel, still detained at Morat, hearing
the sound of his <i>drum</i>, as Luther says, made an effort
to walk: he left the latter town, and proceeded to
Orbe. On the next market-day, being determined to
resist the new Tetzel, he quitted his inn and went to
the market-place, where he found the indulgence-seller
offering his wares with much shouting. The
monk, whose eye was always on the watch, soon
noticed in the middle of the crowd a little man with
a red beard and piercing eyes who caused him some
uneasiness. Farel, approaching slowly, took his
place quietly before the stall and said to the quack,
just as an ordinary purchaser would have done, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">{243}</a></span>
with concentrated anger: 'Have you indulgences for
a person who has killed his father and mother?' Without
waiting for an answer, and wishing to undeceive
the superstitious crowd, he boldly stept on the basin
of the public fountain, and began to preach as if he
were in the pulpit. The astonished market-people
left the monk and gathered round the new orator,
whose sonorous voice entreated the multitude to ask
pardon of the Saviour instead of buying indulgences
from the monk. As the priests and the devout were
exceedingly irritated at both preaching and preacher,
Farel could not remain at Orbe; but a few drops of
living water had gushed forth, and some souls had had
their thirst quenched by them. A tradesman, Christopher
Hollard by name, and one Mark Romain, a schoolmaster,
were converted to the gospel at this time.</p>

<p>The whole town was in commotion, and the sisters
of St. Claire, as bigoted as those of Geneva, entreated
their confessor to preach against heresy. Such a request
had great weight and must be attended to, for
these sisters were held in great consideration. Philippina
of Chalons, Louisa of Savoy, recently canonised
at Rome, and Yoland, grand-daughter of St. Louis,
had assumed the veil in this convent. The struggle
might take place more freely in Orbe than in many
other Vaudois towns. The Sires of Chateau-Guyon,
who possessed the lordship at the time of the war
between Switzerland and Burgundy, having taken the
part of Charles the Bold, had been deprived of their
possessions by the League, and the suzerainty adjudged
in 1476 to the cantons of Berne and Friburg.
The municipal magistrates, chosen from the principal
burgesses or nobles of the city, were good catholics;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">{244}</a></span>
but the superior authority belonged to a bailiff, living
at Echallens, and who was by turns a Friburger or a
Bernese. Now Berne was zealous for the Reform.
The friar-confessor, full of confidence in himself,
smiled at the flattering request the nuns of St. Claire
had made him, and having no mistrust of his eloquence,
he said to the banneret, the Sire de Pierrefleur:
'I shall <i>create</i> these Lutherans <i>anew</i> in the faith, as
they were before.' Noble de Pierrefleur, a fervent
catholic but a man of good sense, who knew the firmness
of the reformers and saw Berne in the background,
did not believe that the new <i>creation</i>, with
which the monk flattered himself, was such an easy
thing, and answered: 'I am far from your opinion,
father, for such people have more obstinacy than
knowledge, and great is the folly of those who desire
to remonstrate with them.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_381" id="Ref_381" href="#Foot_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=FRIAR MICHAEL'S SERMON.=</p>

<p>Michael Juliani (for that was the friar's name) was
not to be stopped by this opinion, and he gave notice
of his sermons against the Reform, which were talked
about all over the city. The bells rang; priests, monks,
and devotees filled the church, and even those suspected
of Lutheranism attended. The orator was
filled with joy at the sight of the unusual crowd,
and his head was turned. Had not his patron saint,
the archangel Michael, armed with a golden spear,
trampled Satan under his feet; and should he not
gain a similar victory? Losing all moderation, he
began to extol in the most pompous terms Rome, the
priesthood, and celibacy, and to attack the reformers
with violence and abuse. Five or six Lutherans were
noticed in the church, pen in hand, writing down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">{245}</a></span>
all the father said on a piece of paper which they held
on their knees. When the sermon was over, the
offended bailiff of Diesbach, the grand banneret and
other notables, displeased with the presumptuous discourse,
accosted the friar and begged him to desist
from abusive language and to preach simply the doctrines
of the Church. But in the eyes of certain
devout folks, the greater Michael's abuse, the greater
his eloquence.</p>

<p>The confessor, delighted at his success, and thinking,
as they did in many convents, that knowledge is
a sign of the children of the devil (Farel had studied
at the university of Paris), and ignorance that of the
children of God, went into the pulpit again on the
25th March, and took for his text: <i>Blessed are the
poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven</i>.
'Sirs,' he exclaimed, 'the poor in spirit here referred
to are the priests and friars. They have not much
learning, I confess, but they have what is better; they
are mediators between man and God, worshippers of
the Virgin Mary, who is the treasure-house of all
graces, and friends of the saints who cure all diseases....
What then can those want who listen to them?
But who are the people who say they are justified by
faith? who are they who throw down the crosses on
our roads and in our chapels?... Enemies of Christ.
What are those priests, monks, and nuns who renounce
their vows in order to marry?—Unclean, impure,
infamous, abominable apostates before men and before
God.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_382" id="Ref_382" href="#Foot_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p>The friar was continuing in this strain, when suddenly
a loud noise was heard in the church. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">{246}</a></span>
evangelicals present had been excited at the very
commencement of the discourse; at first they had
restrained themselves, and then whispered to each
other; but when the monk began to insult those who
thought (as the Bible says) that <i>marriage is honourable
to all men</i>, one of them, unable to contain himself,
stood up and before the whole assembly repeated
twice and with sonorous voice, the words: 'You lie!'...
The orator stopped in amazement, and everybody
turned towards the quarter whence these words proceeded.
They saw a man of middle age standing
there greatly agitated. It was Christopher Hollard,
who had been converted by Farel's first sermon, and
who combined an honest heart with a violent character.
His brother, John Hollard, the late dean of
Friburg, had embraced the Reformation and married;
Christopher, fancying the monk was reflecting on his
brother, had hastened to protest, rather coarsely, it
must be acknowledged, but with the frankness of an
honest heart, which sees the commandment of God
blasphemed.</p>

<p class="side">=HOLLARD IMPRISONED.=</p>

<p>This exclamation had hardly resounded through
the church, when a great uproar, caused by the people,
drowned the Lutheran's voice. The men who
were present would have rushed from their places
upon the disturber; but the women who filled the
nave were before them. 'All with one accord fell
upon the said Christopher, tore out his beard and
beat him; they scratched his face with their nails and
otherwise, so that if they had been let alone, he would
never have gone out of the said church, which would
have been a great benefit for poor catholics.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_383" id="Ref_383" href="#Foot_383">[383]</a></span>
Thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">{247}</a></span>
spoke the grand banneret, who had lost, as it would
seem, a little of the moderation he had shown on
other occasions. The castellan, Anthony Agasse, was
not of his opinion: he wanted the culprits, if there
were any, to be punished by the law and not by the
populace; and rushing into the midst of this savage
scene, he rescued Hollard from the hands of the
furies, and threw him 'into a dungeon to avoid a
greater scandal.'</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER II.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">PLOT OF THE WOMEN AGAINST REFORM;
 FAREL'S PREACHING.<br />
 (1531.)</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">The Reformation brought great benefits to women.
The divine Word which it placed in their hands,
and which it desired to see in their hearts, would free
them from the dominion of the priest to put them
under that of the Saviour; give them that meek and
peaceful spirit which (as Calvin says) becomes their
sex; and substitute for a religion of external practices
an inner, holy, and useful life. However, the women,
attached to their priests and ceremonies, and who are
easily aroused, were often opposed to the Reform, of
which we shall have instances.</p>

<p>Hollard's mother was not of this number. Strongly
attached to her son, she gave way to her maternal
sorrow. Her son a prisoner, her son without a
protector, her son exposed to the vengeance of the
exasperated Roman-catholics—thoughts like these
caused her the deepest anxiety. She could think of
nothing but saving him, ready to incur any danger,
and to brave even the anger of the enemies of the
gospel. The bailiff of Berne, she said to herself, alone
can save Hollard. He lives at Echallens, in a castle,
surrounded with his officers; he is a haughty Bernese,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">{249}</a></span>
a cold diplomatist perhaps.... It matters not; the
poor woman will go and implore his help. Romain
will not abandon her; if there are any difficulties,
any dangers, he will be near her; he will protect the
mother and deliver the son. Madame Hollard and the
schoolmaster set off together for Echallens, and presenting
themselves at the castle, inform the bailiff of
Diesbach of the monk's insulting address and its
consequences.... O happiness! the Bernese magistrate
is moved, grows angry, and departs immediately.
The lord-bailiff felt that the friar's insults
were the cause of all the disorder; that by denouncing
the married priests and monks as apostates and villains,
he had attacked the gospel and the Reformation,
recognised by My Lords of Berne; and that the friar
was the person to be blamed.</p>

<p class="side">=FRIAR MICHAEL ARRESTED.=</p>

<p>Arriving the same day about four o'clock, Diesbach
would not go to the guildhall or the castellan's; but
sitting down in the open air near the old castle,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_384" id="Ref_384" href="#Foot_384">[384]</a></span>
he sent his officers to fetch Friar Juliani. The sergeants
carefully searched the convent and several houses
without finding the monk, who was hiding in the
house of a woman named 'Frances Pugin, instructress
of girls in all virtue and learning.' Being informed
of the search, he took courage, left the house, and
went straight to the bailiff, who was still seated in
front of the castle, waiting the result of his enquiries.
Friar Michael saluted him respectfully; but the lord
of Diesbach, rising up, caught him by the hand and
said: 'I arrest you in the name of My Lords,' and
then, taking him to the prison, 'drew Hollard out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">{250}</a></span>
of his hole and put the said friar in his place.' Such
were the energetic proceedings of Berne.</p>

<p class="side">=ROMAIN IS ILL-TREATED.=</p>

<p>Mark Romain, as pleased at having rescued his
friend, 'as if he had gained a thousand crowns, and
thinking he had achieved a master-piece,' says a
contemporary, was going quietly home. Meanwhile
the people, alarmed at the arrival of the bailiff and the
imprisonment of the monk, had assembled in the
market-place, and spoke of flinging the schoolmaster
into the river to punish him for having gone to fetch
the Sieur de Diesbach. Unfortunately Mark Romain
came in sight just at this moment. The townspeople,
'seeing him come joyfully along,' pointed him out to
one another. 'There he is,' they said, and began to
cry: 'Master, come here!' Romain, observing the
tumult, passed suddenly from joy to fear and took to
flight, all following in pursuit. They gained upon him:
he looked from side to side to see if some door would
not open to receive him, but all remained closed. Arriving
in front of the church, he rushed into it; but
had hardly set his feet inside, when he stopped in astonishment.
The women who had desired to tear Hollard
to pieces were in the church, as well as some men,
on account of the <i>Salve Regina</i> which was said daily at
five in the afternoon. Kneeling before the altar, with
clasped hands and eyes turned to the ground, they
were invoking the <i>Queen of heaven</i>: 'Hail, queen of
mercy; we send up our groans to thee! O thou who
art our advocate, save us!' At the moment when
Romain entered, the women turned their heads and
caught sight of him; being suddenly changed into
furies, they rushed upon him, as they had done before
upon Hollard, 'caught him by the hair, threw him on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">{251}</a></span>
the ground, and beat him.' The women were the
champions of Catholicism in Orbe. The grand banneret
looked on quietly at this execution. 'I saw
the whole affair,' he said, 'and I did not think the
schoolmaster would ever get out alive.' Pierrefleur
took care not to go to his help, and the blows
continued to fall on poor Romain, until one of his
friends arrived. 'I am certain,' says the banneret,
who had seen all this without being moved, 'that had
it not been for the assistance he received from this
Lutheran, he would never have gone out of the place
until he was dead.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_385" id="Ref_385" href="#Foot_385">[385]</a></span>
We read in Scripture of people
who ceased not to beat St. Paul; Romain, who
experienced 'this riotous and cruel rage,' was afterwards
a minister of the gospel. He was now going
through his apprenticeship.</p>

<p>A mob had collected round the castle in which Friar
Michael was confined, and angry voices were heard
loudly demanding his liberty. At this moment the
bailiff of Diesbach came out to return to his place of
residence, having Hollard by his side, whom he was
going to restore to his mother. When he saw the crowd
he was much astonished, for 'all were crying out and
demanding their good father.' 'Why have you arrested
Friar Michael?' asked some. 'Why have you
delivered Christopher?' asked others. 'By order of
My Lords of Berne,' answered the imperturbable
bailiff; and then added, pointing to the lofty walls of
the castle, 'If you can set him at liberty, you may
take him ... but I advise you not.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_386" id="Ref_386" href="#Foot_386">[386]</a></span>
'We will be bail for our good father, body for body, goods for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">{252}</a></span>
goods,' exclaimed the burgesses; but the bailiff kept
on his way without answering them.</p>

<p>The Sieur of Diesbach had hardly arrived at the
great square, when he perceived the ladies and other
women of the city waiting for him, their hearts full
of sorrow and anguish. They all fell on their knees
'with many tears,' and stretching their hands towards
him exclaimed: 'Mercy for the good father! set him
at liberty!' These cries softened the Bernese, he
stopped and could hardly speak for emotion. He
made them understand, however, that it was not in
his power to liberate Juliani, and then returned home,
for 'the hour was late.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_387" id="Ref_387" href="#Foot_387">[387]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=FAREL ARRIVES AT ORBE.=</p>

<p>The principal catholics now assembled to consider
what was to be done. A priest put in prison in Orbe,
for a strictly Romish sermon.... What a scandal!
They resolved to appeal from the heretical Bernese
bailiff to the Friburgers who were good catholics.
The grand banneret volunteered for this important
mission, and next day Noble P. de Pierrefleur and
Francis Vuerney set out for Friburg, where they related
everything to the council. The lords and princes
of that city were much 'concerned and vexed,' and
a deputation composed of Bernese and Friburgers
received instructions to arrange the difference. But
this measure, far from diminishing the struggle, was
destined to increase it. As the deputation passed
through Avenches, a Roman city older than the
Cæsars, they fell in with Farel, who for more than
a month had been preaching the gospel there, amid
its ruined aqueducts and amphitheatres, and had met
with nothing but lukewarmness. Without hesitation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">{253}</a></span>
the evangelist left Avenches, and departing with the
Bernese arrived at the banks of the Orbe, whither
the noise of battle attracted him. No ruins were to
be seen there: but seven churches and twenty-six
altars testified to the ancient splendour and Romish
fervour of the city.</p>

<p>It was the 2nd of April, Palm-Sunday. Mass had
been celebrated, the various offices had been said, even
to vespers. Farel, who had stayed quietly in doors,
observing that the service was over, left his inn 'with
presumptuous boldness.' His friends followed him,
idlers flocked round him, the devout ran after, and a
crowd of men, women, and children soon filled the
church with a great noise. Then 'without asking
leave of any one, Farel went into the pulpit to preach.'
But he had scarcely opened his mouth, when everybody,
'men, women, and children, hissed, howled, and
stamped with all sorts of exclamations to disconcert
him. Dog, they cried; lubber, heretic, devil, and
other insults: it was a glorious noise.' 'You really
could not have heard God's thunder,' said Pierrefleur.
Farel, who was accustomed to tumult, as a soldier to
the whistling of the bullets, continued his address.
Anger got the better of some of them. 'Seeing that
he would not desist, they grew riotous, surrounded the
pulpit, pulled him out of it, and would even have proceeded
to blows.' The confusion was at its height,
when the bailiff, 'fearing that worse would follow,'
rushed into the midst of the crowd, took the reformer
by the arm, and escorted him to his lodging.</p>

<p>The mixed commission was empowered to restore
peace to this agitated city; but as for Farel he had
but one idea: <i>Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">{254}</a></span>
If he cannot preach it in the church, he will do so in
the open air. On the following day (Monday) he left
the house of his entertainer at six in the morning,
and proceeding towards the great square, began to
preach. There was nobody present; it mattered
not; he thought that his powerful voice would soon
collect a good assembly. But satisfied with the
victory of the evening before, the inhabitants of Orbe
had said to themselves that they would leave the
preacher alone: he had not a single hearer.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_388" id="Ref_388" href="#Foot_388">[388]</a></span>
That was not, however, the only reason: a plot was concerting
against Farel—a women's plot naturally; for the
men in general were cold in comparison with the
other sex.</p>

<p>There was a noble dame at Orbe, a native of
Friburg, Elizabeth, wife of Hugonin, lord of Arnex,
an honest and devout woman, but enthusiastic, violent,
and fanatical. Elizabeth, being persuaded that
the death of the reformer would be a very meritorious
work, had assembled at her house some other bigoted
women, had addressed them, and worked upon them,
so that they had agreed to beat the reformer and even
kill him: they only waited for an opportunity. The
same day at four in the afternoon a city council was
held at which the deputies of Berne and Friburg and
even Farel also were present. When the council was
over, the reformer came out: it was the moment
that Elizabeth and her accomplices, informed of the
circumstance, had selected to carry out their plot.
A gentleman, Pierre de Glairesse, knowing the danger
the evangelist ran, quitted the council after him, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">{255}</a></span>
begged permission to accompany him. Meanwhile
the women who had left their houses were waiting
for Farel in the middle of a street through which he
must necessarily pass. Approaching them without
any mistrust, they fell upon him unawares, 'and took
him by the cloak <i>so gently</i>,' says the chronicler ironically,
'that they made him stagger and fall.' They
then attempted to ill-treat him and beat him; but
Pierre de Glairesse rushing in between them, took
him out of their hands, and said, bowing to them very
politely: 'Your pardon, ladies; at present he is under
my charge.' They all let go of him, and Glairesse
conducted him to the inn where My Lords of Berne
awaited him.</p>

<p class="side">=FRIAR MICHAEL EXAMINED.=</p>

<p>While Elizabeth was trying to kill the reformer,
her husband, William of Arnex, as bigoted as herself,
was pleading the cause of the monk. The mediators
had ordered that Friar Michael should be
put on his trial. He was taken to the castle in agitation
and alarm, and the lords of Berne, bringing a
criminal charge against him, said: 'You asserted that
the poor in spirit are the monks.'</p>

<p><i>Friar Michael</i>: 'I deny it.'</p>

<p>'You said that to resist the pope, the bishops, and
other ecclesiastics is resisting the commandment of
God.'</p>

<p><i>Friar.</i> 'I deny saying it in those terms.'</p>

<p>'You said that few follow the new law, except a
heap of lascivious monks.'</p>

<p><i>Friar.</i> 'I deny having said it in that way, and I
named nobody.'</p>

<p>'You said that when priests marry, the women
they take are not their wives but their harlots, and
that their children are bastards.'</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">{256}</a></div>

<p><i>Friar.</i> 'I confess it.'</p>

<p>'You said that Mary was the treasure-house of
graces.'</p>

<p><i>Friar.</i> 'I did.'</p>

<p>'You said the saints, like St. Anthony, expel and
cure certain diseases.'</p>

<p><i>Friar.</i> 'I did.'</p>

<p>'You said that those who deny that the books of
the Maccabees form part of Holy Scripture, are
heretics.'</p>

<p><i>Friar.</i> 'I did.'</p>

<p>'You said that those who have adopted the new
law have no good in them, and deny the articles of
faith.'</p>

<p><i>Friar.</i> 'I did not.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_389" id="Ref_389" href="#Foot_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p>This mixture of denials and confessions disarmed
the judges. They listened to the solicitations of
D'Arnex and set Juliani at liberty. The Bernese,
however, bound him to preach in future nothing but
the Word of God. 'Most honoured lords,' exclaimed
the poor friar, 'I have never preached anything that
is not found in the holy gospel, in the epistles of St.
Paul, or in some other part of Holy Scripture.'
Friar Michael, confounded at not gaining a triumph
as striking as that of his patron with the brilliant
helmet, and fearing lest he should be sent back to
prison, thought only of saving himself. He entered
the convent for a short time, and then fled into Burgundy,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_390" id="Ref_390" href="#Foot_390">[390]</a></span>
The deputies returned home and Farel remained.</p>

<p>Shortly after Easter there came a mandate from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">{257}</a></span>
Berne ordering that whenever Farel desired to preach,
he should be given a hearing, support, and favour.
As soon as the mandate had been read, the people,
without waiting for the opinion of the Council,
exclaimed, 'Let him go about his business, we do
not want him or his preaching.' The lords of Berne
answered that Farel was to be free to speak, but
that no inhabitant was constrained to hear him.
The evangelist gave notice that he would preach on
the Saturday after Quasimodo, at one o'clock, when
he would expose Juliani's errors.</p>

<p class="side">=FAREL'S STRANGE CONGREGATION.=</p>

<p>The catholics, not content with the permission
given them to keep away, determined to organise a
reception for Farel that should disgust him for ever
with preaching. As soon as the minister entered the
church the strangest of congregations met his eyes:
all the brats (<i>marmaille</i>) of the place were assembled;
lying in front of the pulpit and all round it, the
children pretended to be asleep, snoring and laughing
in their sleeves. Farel observing three persons who
appeared to be serious, went into the pulpit and
said, pointing to the little ragamuffins: 'How many
weapons Satan has provided to hinder our cause!
Never mind, we must surmount every obstacle.'
Being determined to refute Friar Michael, he began
his discourse; but on a sudden the children started
to their feet, as sharp-shooters lying flat behind the
bushes start up at the approach of the enemy, and
salute him with their fire. The young scamps
exerted their lungs, howling and shouting with all
their might, and at last quitted the church with a
horrible uproar. 'Nobody was left but the minister,
quite amazed. And this was the first sermon preached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">{258}</a></span>
in the town of Orbe,' says the grand banneret maliciously.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_391" id="Ref_391" href="#Foot_391">[391]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day, Sunday, there was a great procession.
Priests, monks, and all the parish, chanting as
loud as they could, proceeded according to custom to
St. George's, outside the town. Farel profited by the
departure of the enemy to seize upon the place, and
the last parishioner had hardly crossed the threshold
of the church, when he entered it, followed by his
friends, went up into the pulpit, and loudly declared
the truth. Ten evangelicals, Viret, Hollard, Secretan,
Romain, and six of their friends, composed the whole
of his congregation. Meanwhile the procession was
on its way back. First appeared the children two and
two, then the exorcist with the holy water and the
sprinkler, then came the priests, magistrates, and
people, all singing the litany. The children, seeing
the minister in the pulpit, and remembering the lesson
they had received, rushed into the church, whistling,
howling, and shouting as on the evening before. The
priests and people who followed them made threatening
motions, and Farel, understanding that the storm
was about to burst, showed a moderation he did not
always possess, came down from the pulpit and went out.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_392" id="Ref_392" href="#Foot_392">[392]</a></span></p>

<p>The clergy exulted: they ascribed Farel's retreat
to weakness and fear, and said openly in the city:
'The minister cannot refute the articles of faith established
by Juliani.' 'Indeed,' answered the Bernese
bailiff, 'you have heard the monk and you now
complain that you have not heard the minister....
Very good! you shall hear him. It is the will of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">{259}</a></span>
the lords of Berne that every father of a family be
required to attend his sermon under pain of their
displeasure.'</p>

<p class="side">=FAREL ON PENANCE.=</p>

<p>They dared not disobey, and the church was
thronged. Filled with joy at the sight of such a congregation,
Farel ascended the pulpit: never had he
been clearer, more energetic and more eloquent. He
passed in review all the subjects of which Juliani had
treated; at one time attacking the pardons which the
Romish Church sells to credulous souls, at another the
doctrine which assigns the keys of heaven to St. Peter.
'The key of the kingdom of heaven,' he said, 'is the
Word of God—the Holy Gospel.' One day Farel
spoke of the stupid practices imposed upon catholics
under the name of penance. 'The penance which
God demands,' he said, 'is a change of heart, life,
and conversation.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_393" id="Ref_393" href="#Foot_393">[393]</a></span>
Another day he battled with
indulgences: 'The pope's pardons take away <i>money</i>,'
he said, 'but they do not take away <i>sin</i>. Let every
christian be aware that nobody can escape the anger
of God, except through Jesus.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_394" id="Ref_394" href="#Foot_394">[394]</a></span>
He thundered against auricular confession: 'Confession in the
priest's ears which the pope commands,' he said,
'helps him to learn the secrets of kings and aids him
in catching countries and kingdoms. But how many
souls have been cast into hell by it! how many virgins
corrupted! how many widows devoured! how many
orphans ruined! how many princes poisoned! how
many countries wasted! how many large establishments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">{260}</a></span>
of men and women given up to debauchery.... O
Heaven, unveil these accursed horrors! O Earth, cry
out! Creatures of God, weep; and do thou, O Lord,
arise!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_395" id="Ref_395" href="#Foot_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p>Farel, without possessing the iconoclastic ardour
which Hollard displayed ere long, was indignant at
the worship paid to the images of the saints, and
strove against them with the arms of the Word.
'The people,' he said, 'set candles before the saints
who are out of this world and have nothing to do with
them.... While if those saints were alive and had
need of a light to read the Gospel by, instead of giving
them candles, you would tear out their eyes!' ...
Then scandalised at the disorderly living of the world
and the Church, the christian orator exclaimed:
'Farces full of scoffing, filth, and ribaldry: obscene
and idle songs, books full of vanity, lewdness, falsehood
and blasphemy, wicked and illicit conversations
... all this is suffered openly.... But the
New Testament which contains the doctrine and
passion of Christ is forbidden, as if it were the Koran
of Mahomet, or a book of witchcraft and enchantment....
O Sun, canst thou pour thy light on such countries?
O Earth, canst thou give thy fruits to such
people? And thou, O Lord God, is thy vengeance so
slow against such a great outrage? Arise, O Lord,
and let the trumpet of thy holy Gospel be heard unto
the ends of the earth.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_396" id="Ref_396" href="#Foot_396">[396]</a></span></p>

<p>Although the catholics were indignant, and not
without reason, at the order from Berne, which
obliged them to attend the sermons opposed to their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">{261}</a></span>
faith, the reformer preached without difficulty the
first and second day; but on the third, the alarmed
priests harangued their flocks and thundered from
their pulpits against the heretical discourses; and
from that time Farel counted few hearers in the
church besides the friends of the Gospel. The bailiff
had the good sense not to observe this disobedience.</p>

<p class="side">=FAREL'S CARE FOR THE MINISTRY.=</p>

<p>The surrounding districts compensated Farel for
the contempt of Orbe. His reputation having spread
into the neighbouring villages, the people eagerly desired
to hear him. Receiving message after message,
and touched at the sight of these worthy peasants
knocking at his door, he wrote to Zwingle: 'Oh! how
great is the harvest! No one can describe the ardour
the people feel for the Gospel, and the tears I shed when
I see the small number of reapers.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_397" id="Ref_397" href="#Foot_397">[397]</a></span>
Several of the evangelicals of Orbe asked to be sent out to preach,
but Farel, thinking them not ripe enough, refused.
There were some who took offence at this, but it did
not move Farel. 'It is better to offend them,' he said,
'than to offend God.'</p>

<p>Saint Paul said: <i>Lay hands suddenly on no man</i>.
Farel and the other reformers desired that the minister
should honour his ministry. He required above
all things a converted heart, but that was not enough.
It is a bad sign when the Church admits into the
number of those who are to point out the gate of
salvation, either men who have not passed through it
or who have not the gift of the Word, or are deficient
in wisdom. But if the leaders of the Church are
faithful, God will send them true ministers.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER III.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">A NEW REFORMER AND AN IMAGE-BREAKER.<br />
 (1531.)</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN 1511 William Viret, a burgess of Orbe, 'cloth-dresser
and tailor,' had a son born to him whom he
named Peter. The boy had grown up in the midst of
the wool-combers, and had watched his father's workmen
as they pressed, or glossed, or fulled the cloths
as they came from the hands of the weavers. But he
took no delight in this, for he was not born a tradesman.
It was the inner man that was to be developed in him:
he felt within himself a necessity for seeking God,
which impelled him towards heaven. He sought the
society of the best-informed burgesses, and even had
some relations with the nobles;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_398" id="Ref_398" href="#Foot_398">[398]</a></span>
but the first object
of his wishes was God. If he took a walk alone, or
with one of his brothers Anthony and John, along the
picturesque banks of the Orbe, through the charming
country bathed by its waters, and even to the foot of the Jura,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_399" id="Ref_399" href="#Foot_399">[399]</a></span>
he looked around him with delight, but
afterwards lifted his eyes to heaven. 'I was naturally
given to religion,' he said, 'of which however I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">{263}</a></span>
then ignorant.... I was preparing myself for heaven,
seeing that it was the way of salvation.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_400" id="Ref_400" href="#Foot_400">[400]</a></span>
He resolved to devote himself to the service of the altar,
which his father did not oppose, townspeople and
peasantry alike regarding it as an honour to count a
priest among their children. Peter, who had a good
understanding and memory, soon learnt all that was
taught in the school at Orbe, and turned his eyes
towards the University of Paris, that great light which
twelve years before had attracted Farel's footsteps.
His father, whose trade had placed him in easy circumstances,
consented to send him to Paris, whither the
boy proceeded in 1523, being then a little over twelve
years of age. The same year and about the same time
John Calvin of Noyon, who was two years older
than Viret, arrived in the same city and entered the
college of La Marche. Did these two boys, who were
one day to be so closely united, meet then, and did
their friendship begin with their childhood? We
have not been able to satisfy ourselves on the point.</p>

<p class="side">=VIRET GOES TO PARIS.=</p>

<p>Viret distinguished himself at college by his love
of study; 'he made good progress in learning;' and
also by his devotion to the practices of the Roman
Church. 'I cannot deny,' he said, 'that I went
pretty deep into that Babylon.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_401" id="Ref_401" href="#Foot_401">[401]</a></span>
In one of the
last visits he made to Paris, Farel seems to have
remarked Viret, whose charming modesty easily won
the heart, and to have helped in freeing the young
Swiss from the darkness in which he still lay. The
Gospel penetrated the soul of the youthful scholar of
Orbe almost at the same time as it enlightened the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">{264}</a></span>
large understanding of the scholar of Noyon. The
mildness of his character softened the struggles which
had been so fierce in Farel and Calvin. And yet he
too had to tread the path of anguish to arrive at peace.
Perceiving a frightful abyss and an eternal night
beneath his feet, he threw himself into the arms of the
Deliverer who was calling him: 'While still at college,'
he said, 'God took me out of the labyrinth of error
before I had sunk deeper into that Babylon of Antichrist.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_402" id="Ref_402" href="#Foot_402">[402]</a></span>
The time having arrived when he should
receive the tonsure, he felt that he must make up his
mind: the struggle was not a long one; he refused,
and was immediately 'set down as belonging to the
Lutheran religion.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_403" id="Ref_403" href="#Foot_403">[403]</a></span>
Foreseeing what awaited him,
he hastily quitted Paris and France, and 'returned to
his father's house.' In after years he exclaimed: 'I
thank God that the mark and sign of the beast were
not set upon my forehead.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_404" id="Ref_404" href="#Foot_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=VIRET'S STRUGGLES.=</p>

<p>Viret found Orbe greatly changed; the contest then
going on between the gospel and popery intimidated
him at first. His was one of those reflective souls
which, absorbed by the struggles within, naturally
shrink from those without. Like other reformers, he
had a difficulty in quitting the body of catholicity,
but a severe conscience obliged him to seek truth at
any sacrifice. Sometimes the Church of Rome, with
all its errors and abuses, alone struck his imagination,
and he would exclaim with emotion: 'It is the stronghold
of superstition, the fortress of Satan.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_405" id="Ref_405" href="#Foot_405">[405]</a></span>
Then all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">{265}</a></span>
of a sudden and before he had time to defend himself,
the old system of catholicism resumed its power over
him, and he found himself in anguish and darkness.
He struggled and prayed: the truth, for a moment
hidden, reappeared before his eyes, and he said: 'Rome
asserts that antiquity is truth; but what is there older
in the world than lies, rebellion, murder, extortion,
impurity, idolatry, and all kinds of wickedness and
abomination?... To follow the doctrine of Cain and
of Sodom is verily to follow an old doctrine.... But
virtue, truth, holiness, innocence, and thou, O God
which art the Father of them all, are older still!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_406" id="Ref_406" href="#Foot_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>The priests of Orbe, who were strongly attached to
the Romish doctrine, seeing the cloth-dresser's son
often solitary and full of care, began to grow uneasy
about him: they accosted him and spoke of the old
doctors, of the testimony of the saints, of Augustin,
Cyprian, Chrysostom, and Jerome. These testimonies
had much weight in Viret's mind. His head was bewildered,
his feet slipped, and he was on the point of
falling back into the gulf, when snatching again at the
word of God, he clung to it, saying: 'No, I will not
believe because of Tertullian or Cyprian, or Origen,
or Chrysostom, or Peter Lombard, or Thomas Aquinas,
not even because of Erasmus or Luther.... If I did
so, I should be the disciple of men.... I will believe
only Jesus Christ my Shepherd.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_407" id="Ref_407" href="#Foot_407">[407]</a></span></p>

<p>At length the divine Word delivered Viret from the
theocratic dominion of Rome, and he then began to
look around him.... Alas! what did he see? Chains
everywhere, prisoners held fast 'in the citadel of idolatry.'
He felt the tenderest affection for the captives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">{266}</a></span>
'Since the Lord has brought me <i>out</i>' he said, 'I cannot
forget those who are <i>within</i>.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_408" id="Ref_408" href="#Foot_408">[408]</a></span>
Two of these prisoners
were never out of his thoughts: they were his father
and mother. At one time absorbed by the cares of
business, at another mechanically attending divine
service, they did not seek after the one thing needful.
The pious son began to pray earnestly for his parents,
to show them increased respect, to read them a few
passages of Holy Scripture, and to speak gently to
them of the Saviour. They felt attracted by his
conduct, and the faith he professed took hold of their
hearts. The grateful Viret was able to say: 'I have
much occasion to give thanks to God in that it hath
pleased him to make use of me to bring my father
and mother to the knowledge of the Son of God....
Ah! if he had made my ministry of no other use, I
should have had good cause to bless him.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_409" id="Ref_409" href="#Foot_409">[409]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as Viret met Farel again at Orbe, he
immediately became one of the evangelist's hearers,
and ere long took his father along with him. The most
intimate union sprung up between these men of God.
One completed the other. If Farel was ardent, intrepid,
and almost rash, Viret 'had a wondrously meek temper.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_410" id="Ref_410" href="#Foot_410">[410]</a></span>
There was in him a grace that won the heart,
and a christian sensibility that was really touching; and
yet, like Farel and Calvin, he was firm in doctrine and
morals. Farel, always eager to send workmen into the
harvest, persuaded his friend to preach not only in the
country but in Orbe itself. The young and timid Viret
recoiled from the task Farel proposed to him; but the
reformer pressed him, as others had pressed Luther
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">{267}</a></span>
and Calvin; he believed that Viret, who belonged to
the city, and was loved by everybody, would receive a
favourable welcome. The thought of the divine grace,
the strength of which he knew, decided Viret. 'Let
it not be my mouth which persuades,' he said, 'but
the mouth of Jesus Christ; for it is Jesus Christ who
pierces the heart with the fiery arrow of his Spirit.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_411" id="Ref_411" href="#Foot_411">[411]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=VIRET PREACHES AT ORBE.=</p>

<p>On the 6th May 1531 an unusual crowd, not only
of townspeople but of persons from the neighbourhood,
filled the church of Orbe; the son of one of the most
respected of the burgesses, a child of the place, was
to enter the pulpit. He was accused of being rather
heretical, but he was so inoffensive, that nobody would
believe it; and besides, many of the young folks of
Orbe, who had sported with him on the banks of the
river, wished to see their old playfellow in the pulpit.
The congregation, who were waiting impatiently, saw
the young man appear at last: he was of small stature
and pale complexion, his face thin and long, his eyes
lively, and the whole expression meek and winning;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_412" id="Ref_412" href="#Foot_412">[412]</a></span>
he was only twenty years old, but appeared to be
younger still. He preached: his sermon was accompanied
by so much unction and learning, his language
was so persuasive, his eloquence so searching and penetrating,
that even the most worldly men were attracted
by his discourse and hung, as it were, upon his lips.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_413" id="Ref_413" href="#Foot_413">[413]</a></span>
The proverb 'No man is a prophet in his own country'
was not exemplified in Viret's case. The 6th of May
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">{268}</a></span>
was a great day for him. All his life through he preserved
the recollection of his first sermons. Thirty
years later he said to the nobles and burgesses of
Orbe: 'Your church was the first in which God was
pleased to make use of my ministry, when it was still
in its youth, and I was very young.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_414" id="Ref_414" href="#Foot_414">[414]</a></span></p>

<p>From that day Viret took his place in that noble
army of heralds of the Word which the Lord was
raising among the nations. His part in it was modest
but well marked. The college of reformers, as well as
the college of the apostles, contained the most different
characters. As the sap is everywhere the same in nature,
the Spirit of God is everywhere the same in the
Church; but everywhere alike each of them produces
different flowers and different fruits. The ardent
Farel was the St. Peter of the Swiss Reform, the
mighty Calvin the St. Paul, and the gentle Viret
the St. John.</p>

<p class="side">=CONVERSION OF ELIZABETH D'ARNEX.=</p>

<p>Farel, Viret, Romain, Hollard, and the other evangelicals
waited for the effects of the preaching at Orbe.
They saw clearly 'some slight touches and pricks, but
few persons had been wounded and pierced to the
quick,' and so overwhelmed with the feeling of everlasting
death, that they thought of looking for help
solely to the grace of Jesus Christ. All of a sudden,
and a month only after Farel's arrival, the report of an
unexpected conversion filled Orbe with astonishment,
and became the subject of general conversation. It
was said—and he who repeated it could hardly believe
it—that Madame Elizabeth, the wife of the lord of
Arnex, the very same who had planned the women's
conspiracy and so severely beaten Farel, was entirely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">{269}</a></span>
changed; that even her husband, who had become bail
for Juliani, and had set him at liberty, had changed
likewise. The bigots of both sexes could not deny the
fact. 'Really,' they said, 'she has become one of the
worst lutherans in the city.' Not long after, they
made a great noise because at All Saints or some
feast of Our Lady, Elizabeth had a large wash or
other manual labours at her house.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_415" id="Ref_415" href="#Foot_415">[415]</a></span>
They shook their heads, shrugged their shoulders, and smiled.
The evangelicals did not imitate them: they thought,
to borrow the language of one of their leaders, that
though these iron-hearted people smiled, it was a
forced smile,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_416" id="Ref_416" href="#Foot_416">[416]</a></span>
for they felt as if inwardly choking....
They knew that God's word is a hammer, and that
there is nothing so hard, so massive, or so hidden in
the heart of man that its power cannot reach....
Had not Paul been a persecutor like Elizabeth and
Hugonin?</p>

<p>Worse still, at least in the opinion of the catholics,
happened ere long. One of the ecclesiastics of the
place was George Grivay, surnamed Calley, an excellent
musician who had been appointed precentor.
He had been trained by a fervent catholic mother,
and had received a good education in the church.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_417" id="Ref_417" href="#Foot_417">[417]</a></span>
In order to receive further instruction his parents had
sent him to Lausanne, where he had been made
chorister and had particularly improved in the knowledge
of music. On his return to Orbe the nobles and
priests had given him a flattering reception; and he
deserved it, for he enchanted the people by his singing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">{270}</a></span>
or electrified them by his discourses. But on the
10th May 1531, the same month in which Viret
delivered his first sermon, Grivat had gone up into
the pulpit and astonished his hearers by preaching the
evangelical doctrine in the clearest manner. This
was too much; his father and his brothers were in
despair; nobles and friends who had received him so
well exclaimed in great irritation: 'Have we not
given him good wages; has not the Church fed and
taught him? and now he wants to imitate the cuckoo
that eats the mother who reared it.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_418" id="Ref_418" href="#Foot_418">[418]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=LORD'S SUPPER AT ORBE.=</p>

<p>As these successive conversions gave the evangelicals
more courage, they took an important step.
Feeling the necessity of being strengthened in the
faith by the celebration of the Lord's Supper, they
asked for it, and Farel, who was then at Morat,
immediately returned to Orbe. On Whitsunday
(28th May) at six in the morning—an hour selected
to insure tranquillity for the act they were about to
perform—he announced to a numerous assembly collected
in the church the remission of all sins by the
breaking of Christ's body on the cross; and as soon as
the sermon was ended, eight disciples came forward
to break bread. They were Hugonin of Arnex and
his wife, C. Hollard and his aged mother, Cordey
and his wife, William Viret, Peter's father, and
George Grivat, afterwards pastor at Avenches; many
of the evangelicals did not think themselves sufficiently
advanced in the faith to take part in this act,
and doubtless Peter Viret was absent. Two of the
eight disciples modestly spread a white cloth over a
bench, on which they placed the bread and wine.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">{271}</a></span>
Farel sank on his knees and prayed, all following his
prayer in their hearts. When the minister rose up
he asked: 'Do you each forgive one another?'...
and the believers answered Yes. Next Farel broke off
a morsel of bread for each, saying he gave it them in
memory of Christ's passion, and after that he handed
them the cup. The minister and these true disciples
possessed by faith the real presence of Jesus in their
hearts. They had hardly finished when the exasperated
priests entered the church hastily and sang
the mass as loud as they could. The next day,
Whitmonday, there was a fresh scandal: the evangelicals
were at work. 'Ha!' said many indignantly;
'they keep no holiday, <i>except the Sunday</i>!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_419" id="Ref_419" href="#Foot_419">[419]</a></span></p>

<p>If the evangelisation had continued in a peaceful
course of christian edification, the city would in all
probability have been entirely gained over; but the
Reformation had its 'enfants terribles.' Calvin said
in vain: 'Those who are wise according to God are
modest, peaceable, and gentle. They do not conceal
vices; they endeavour rather to correct them, but
provided it be in peace, that is to say, with so much
moderation that unity remains unbroken. Peaceable
and loving representations ought not to be laid aside,
and those who desire to be physicians must not be
executioners.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_420" id="Ref_420" href="#Foot_420">[420]</a></span></p>

<p>A fine stone crucifix in St. Germain's cemetery had
been thrown down, and another, which stood at a
cross road near the city, had been destroyed: but this
had been done at night and it was not known by
whom. Ere long the ardent reformers grew bolder, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">{272}</a></span>
especially Christopher Hollard, a true iconoclast of
the Reform, who thought more of pulling down than of
building up. One day, as Farel was preaching before
the deputies of Berne and Friburg, Hollard flew at an
image of the Virgin and dashed it to pieces. Another
day he threw down the great altar of the church of
Our Lady. This was not enough.</p>

<p>According to Hollard, whose mind was upright,
and even pious, but ardent, extreme, and rather
deficient in judgment, the Reformation, that is to say,
the destruction of images and altars, did not go on
fast enough, and he therefore resolved to carry it out
on a grand scale. He took twelve companions with
him; and these agents of the judgments of God
(as they thought themselves), going from street to
street and from church to church, 'pulled down
all the altars' in the seven churches of the city;
twenty-six heaps of rubbish bore witness to their
triumph. They could say, no doubt, that all worship
paid to an image is a relic of paganism; but their fault
was to suppose that catholics ought to adore God, not
according to their catholic conscience, but according to
that of the reformed protestants. The people looked
at each other with alarm, but said nothing. 'I was
greatly astonished,' says De Pierrefleur, 'at the patience
of the populace.' 'Sir banneret,' observed some
catholics, 'if we did not feel great loyalty towards
our lords of Berne, the body of Christopher Hollard
would not have touched earth;' that is to say, they
would have hanged him. These combatants were pretty
well matched for gentleness. The catholics set up
tables in the place of the altars, upon which they
celebrated mass 'rather meanly.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_421" id="Ref_421" href="#Foot_421">[421]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">{273}</a></div>

<p class="side">=ARREST OF THE PRIESTS.=</p>

<p>The intolerance of Christopher Hollard and of one of
his friends, named Tavel, threatened to substitute a
new tyranny for the ancient tyranny of popery. Alas!
the protestant clergy have sometimes been known to
oppose the disciples and doctrines of the gospel, just
as the Romish clergy would have done. Intolerance
is a vice of human nature which even piety does
not always cure. The priests saying mass at their
little tables offended Hollard and Tavel. Agasse
was no longer governor; he had been removed by the
influence of Berne, and Anthony Secretan, one of the
reformed, put in his place. The two fiery Lutherans
laid a complaint before him against all priests as
being murderers (of souls); and according to the
custom of the age, surrendered themselves prisoners.
The governor ordered the Roman ecclesiastics to be
arrested, which was no easy matter, for there were
some sturdy fellows among them. Three sergeants
having attempted to seize Messire Pierre Bovey in
the street, the stout priest 'dragged them into the
passage of a house,' and there beat them so that they
were glad to escape out of his hands. Having thus
defended himself like a lion, he remained free; but it
was not so with Blaise Foret, the curé, who 'went
like a sheep straight to prison.' The officers put him
along with the rest, who were 'well treated at bed
and board, with permission to go all over the castle.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_422" id="Ref_422" href="#Foot_422">[422]</a></span>
Some bold priests (for they were not all shut up)
chanted mass at five o'clock in the morning, notwithstanding
the prohibition. The catholics attended
'armed with pikes, halberds, and clubs; and rang the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">{274}</a></span>
bells as if the city were on fire'. Before long the
intolerant protestants received a severe and well
merited lesson.</p>

<p class="side">=RELEASE OF THE PRIESTS.=</p>

<p>The grand banneret Pierrefleur, who was a man of
the world, well read, of a cultivated mind, charming
simplicity, and profound intelligence, combined great
decision of character with Vaudois good-temper.
Being a catholic from conviction, and knowing that
the majority of the inhabitants were for the Roman
faith, and disgusted at seeing the priests in prison
and the faithful compelled to hear mass almost in
secret, he summoned a general council of the people.
'Will you,' he asked them, 'will you have the mass,
and live and die in the holy faith, like your forefathers?
If you do wish it, let every one hold up
his finger, and if perchance there should be any one
of a contrary opinion, let him leave the assembly.'
Every one raised his finger in token of an oath,
whereupon the Friburgers sent a herald to Orbe.
The priests were taken out of prison, and those who
had helped to pull down the altars were put in their
place. There were fifteen in all, and among them
was Elizabeth's husband, the noble Hugonin of
Arnex. They were not so well treated at 'bed and
board' as the priests had been, but were put on
bread and water; after three days, however, they
were allowed to return home.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_423" id="Ref_423" href="#Foot_423">[423]</a></span>
During this time the
priests and fervent catholics were restoring the altars
everywhere. It required more than twenty years for
the Reform in Orbe to recover from the blow inflicted
on it by the intolerance of Hollard and his friends.
It was not until 1554 that an assembly of the people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">{275}</a></span>
decided by a majority of eighteen votes in favour of
the establishment of evangelical worship. The priests,
nuns, and friars then left the city for ever, amid the
tears of their supporters.<span

 (1531-1532.)</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FAREL'S zeal was not cooled by the check he had
received at Orbe; he saw before him other places
that must be evangelised. If he withstood the ambitious
demands of the new converts who, like Hollard,
fancied themselves more capable than they really were,
and indiscreetly sought for consecration to the holy
office, he did but seek with more zeal for servants
of God, who possessed a spirit of strength, charity,
and prudence. Certain men appeared to him to have
been ripened in France by persecution. He invited
into Switzerland Toussaint, Lecomte, Symphoranus,
Andronicus, and others. As soon as these brethren
arrived, he sent them into the harvest;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_425" id="Ref_425" href="#Foot_425">[425]</a></span>
and frequently
after fervent prayers he seemed to see the whole
valley enclosed between the Jura and the Alps filled
with the living waters of the Gospel. 'Of a truth,'
said he, 'if we look at the times that have gone before,
the work of Christ is glorious now.... And yet what
roots remain to be torn up before the field is ready
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">{277}</a></span>
to receive the divine seed.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_426" id="Ref_426" href="#Foot_426">[426]</a></span>
What works to be
accomplished, what toils to be endured, what enemies
to be overcome!... We have need of labourers
inured to labour.... I cannot promise them mountains of gold,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_427" id="Ref_427" href="#Foot_427">[427]</a></span>
but I know that the Father will never
abandon His own, and that He will give them an
abundant harvest.'</p>

<p class="side">=MALADY OF PETTY QUESTIONS.=</p>

<p>In Farel's heart overwhelming depression often
followed close upon the fairest expectations. One
sorrow especially afflicted him: the malady of petty
questions seemed threatening to invade the new
Church. At all times narrow and ill-balanced minds
attach themselves to certain details in the doctrine of
baptism, the Lord's Supper, the ministry, and so forth:
they are eager about <i>anise and cummin</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_428" id="Ref_428" href="#Foot_428">[428]</a></span>
and by their minutiæ encumber the kingdom of Christ. Farel,
who with a holy doctrine and unwearied activity
combined a wise discernment and a large liberal
spirit, trembled lest this weakness of little understandings
had crept into the minds of the ministers to
whom he addressed his call. There happened to be
at Strasburg just then a christian man named Andronicus,
whom the reformer desired to attract into
Switzerland; but he wished to know whether he was
tainted with formalism or fanaticism—two evils which
sometimes met on the banks of the Rhine. He
resolved to speak frankly to him, and his letter shows
us his opinion of the ministry: 'Dear brother,' he
wrote to Andronicus, 'do you possess Christ so as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">{278}</a></span>
teach Him purely, apart from the empty controversies
of <i>bread</i> and <i>water</i>, <i>taxes</i> and <i>tithes</i>, which in the eyes
of many constitute Christianity?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_429" id="Ref_429" href="#Foot_429">[429]</a></span>
Are you content
to require of all that, renouncing ungodliness and unrighteousness,
they should arm themselves with faith,
and press to their hearts the heavenly treasure, Christ
who sitteth at the right hand of the Father? Are you
ready to give to all authorities what is their due—taxes,
tithes—to pay them not only to the ungodly,
but also to the brethren? Do you seek Christ's glory
only? Do you propose simply to plant in their hearts
the faith that worketh by charity? Are you resolved
to bear the cross? for, be assured, the cross awaits
you at the door. If you are ready to bear it, then,
dear brother, come instantly.' Such was the wise
language of the most ardent of the reformers.</p>

<p class="side">=FAREL'S MODE OF RECRUITING.=</p>

<p>While Farel was thus loudly calling for new workers,
he was getting rid of the idle and cowardly, promising
to all of them fatigue, insult, and persecution: it was
with such promises that the reformer levied his soldiers.
'Do not look for idleness, but for labour,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_430" id="Ref_430" href="#Foot_430">[430]</a></span>
he said; 'only after fatigue will you find repose, and you will
not reap until after you have sown at your own cost.
A wide door is opened, but no one can enter except
those who desire to feed the sheep and not to devour
them, and who are determined to reply with kindness
to the insults with which they are assailed. Labour
and toil await you.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_431" id="Ref_431" href="#Foot_431">[431]</a></span>
I can promise you nothing but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">{279}</a></span>
trouble.... If you will come with us, know that you
are entering into a hard service. You will have to
fight not against craven and disheartened adversaries,
but against enemies brimful of decision and strength.
Be therefore a brave and noble soldier; attack the
enemy joyfully, and rush into the hottest of the fight,
placing your confidence in God, to whom alone belong
the battle and the victory. It is not we who fight,
but the Lord.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_432" id="Ref_432" href="#Foot_432">[432]</a></span></p>

<p>But Farel called to the battle in vain: the timid
recruits would not join the army. He received some
little help indeed, but what was that for so great a
work? Then his appeals grew louder. In the presence
of the gigantic Alps, this humble man rose like
them: his language swelled and resembled rather the
cry of a soldier struggling in the midst of the enemy's
ranks, than the sweet and subtle voice of the Gospel
of peace. 'We are in the thick of the fight,' he said;
'the conflict is terrible; we are fighting man to
man ... but the Lord giveth the victory to his own.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_433" id="Ref_433" href="#Foot_433">[433]</a></span>
Take up the sword, set the helmet on your head,
buckle on the breastplate, hang the shield to your
arm, gird your loins; and being thus armed with the
panoply of God, rush into the midst of the battle,
hurl the darts, throw down the enemy on every side,
and put all the army to flight.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_434" id="Ref_434" href="#Foot_434">[434]</a></span>... But
alas! instead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">{280}</a></span>
of joining the soldiers of Christ, instead of rushing into
the Lord's battles, you fear the cross, and the dangers
that lie in wait for you. Preferring your own ease, you
refuse to come to the assistance of your brethren....
Is that the behaviour of a christian?... The Holy
Scriptures declare that the Lord will exact a severe
reckoning for such cowardice.... Beware lest you
bury the talent you have received.... Call to mind
that you must give an account of all those souls, whom
tyranny holds captive in its gloomy dungeons. You
can set the light before their eyes, you can deliver
them from their chains, you must conjure them to
throw themselves into the arms of Jesus Christ....
Do not hesitate.... Christ must be preferred to
everything. Do not trouble yourself about what your
wife wishes and requires, but about what God asks
and commands.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_435" id="Ref_435" href="#Foot_435">[435]</a></span>
More powerful solicitations had
never been made; there was a new Paul in the world
at this time. At last Farel's earnestness prevailed.
Andronicus and others hastened to him, and laboured
with him in the country that stretches from Basle
and Berne as far as Geneva.</p>

<p class="side">=FIRST BATTLE OF GRANDSON.=</p>

<p>Delighted at receiving such helpers, the reformer
hastened to fresh combats. Every parish, village, and
town was to be won to Christ by an obstinate struggle.
There is no soldier that has fought more battles. We
can only find a parallel to Farel in the convert of
Damascus. He took with him De Glautinis, minister
of Tavannes, in the Bernese Jura, who had come to
his help, and quitted Orbe, leaving on his left the
picturesque gorge of the Jura, where the village of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">{281}</a></span>
St. Croix lies hid, and over which soar the lofty tops of
the Chasseron, and turned his steps towards Grandson.
Ere long he came in sight of the celebrated walls of
the old castle which stood near the extremity of the
lake of Neuchâtel. This place, which was about to
become an evangelical battle-field, had witnessed a
far different struggle. Here, in 1476, the Swiss had
rushed from the heights of Champagne and Bonvillars,
while the terrible roaring of the bull of Uri portended
death, and the cow of Unterwald uttered its warning sound.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_436" id="Ref_436" href="#Foot_436">[436]</a></span>
Here they bent the knee in presence of the
hostile columns, and rising with shouts of '<i>Grandson!</i>'
playing their fearful music, unfurling their
ancient banners, and guarding them with their long
and formidable spears, they charged the Burgundians
with the rush of the tempest. Vainly did the commander
of the cavalry, Sire Louis of Château-Guyon,
brother of the Prince of Orange and of the Lord of
Orbe and Grandson,—vainly did he spur his large
war-horse and charge impetuously at the head of six
thousand horsemen; vainly did he seize the banner
of Schwytz, In der Gruob of Berne had given him a
death-blow, and the Burgundians, as they saw the
gigantic warrior fall, were struck with terror. Grandson
as well as Orbe were lost to the family of that
hero, and the sovereignty of the two towns passed to
the cantons of Berne and Friburg. A panic spread
through the ranks, and Charles the Bold was forced
to fly, leaving behind him four hundred silk tents
embroidered with gold and pearls, six hundred standards,
and an immense quantity of plate, money, jewels,
and precious stones. This vigorous attack and glorious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">{282}</a></span>
victory, the fame of which still remained in that
peaceful country, was a type of the work that Farel
was to accomplish. By his means, Berne was about
to strike at Grandson as well as Orbe a more formidable
enemy than the Lord of Château-Guyon.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_437" id="Ref_437" href="#Foot_437">[437]</a></span></p>

<p>On the shore of the lake at the entrance of the
town stood the vast convent of the Gray Friars.
Farel and his friend De Glautinis, who accompanied
him, stopped before its walls and said to each other
that to this place doubtless the Lord had first directed
their steps. They rang, entered the parlour,
and the superior of the monastery, Friar Guy Regis,
having asked them what they wanted, they begged
him very coolly 'in the name of the Lords of Berne,'
to grant them the use of the church. But Guy Regis,
a resolute man and earnest priest, who knew all that
had happened at Orbe, was offended at such insolence.
'Heretic!' said he to Farel. 'Son of a Jew!' exclaimed
another monk. The reception was not encouraging.
The two ministers discussed with some friends of
the Word of God, what was to be done. 'Go to the
priory on the hill,' said the latter. 'As you bear a
letter from Messieurs of Berne for the prior, the
monks will not dare refuse you.'</p>

<p class="side">=THE BENEDICTINE CONVENT.=</p>

<p>Accordingly Farel, De Glautinis, and a few of the
brethren, proceeded to the Benedictine convent. They
knocked and the door was opened; several monks
appeared. As they knew already something about
the arrival of the missionaries, they looked at them
from head to foot, and Farel had scarcely asked permission
to preach, when a loud uproar arose in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">{283}</a></span>
cloister. The sacristan hid a pistol under his frock,
another friar armed himself with a knife, and both
came forward stealthily to lay hands upon the <i>heretic</i>
who (according to them) was disturbing all the
churches. The sacristan arrived first; pointing the
pistol at Farel with one hand, he seized him with the
other, and pulling him along, endeavoured to drag
him into the convent, where a prison awaited him.
De Glautinis observing this, sprang forward to rescue
his friend, but the other monk, arriving at the scene
of combat, fell upon him, flourishing his knife.
Alarmed by the noise within the cloister, the friends
of the evangelists, who had remained at the door, waiting
to know whether they could hear Farel or not,
rushed in and tore both him and his comrade from
the stout arms of the monks. The gates of the
monastery were closed immediately, and they remained
so for a whole fortnight, so great was the terror inspired
by the reformers.</p>

<p>Farel seeing there was nothing to be done at
Grandson just then, departed for Morat, beseeching De
Glautinis, whom he left behind him, to take advantage
of every opportunity to proclaim the gospel. The
monks entrenched within their walls, trembled, deliberated,
kept watch, and armed themselves against
this one man, as if they had an army before them.
Convent gates and church doors were all close shut.
De Glautinis, finding that he could not preach in the
churches, determined to preach in the streets and in
private houses; but he had hardly begun when the
monks, informed by the signals of their agents whom
they had instructed not to lose sight of the evangelist,
made a vigorous sally. Guy Regis, the valiant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">{284}</a></span>
superior of the Gray Friars, the precentor, and all the
monks came to the place where De Glautinis was
preaching, and boldly placed themselves between him
and his hearers: 'Come,' said the superior, 'come, if
you dare, before the king or the emperor. Come to
Besançon, to Dôle, or to Paris; I will show you and
all the world that your preaching is mere witchcraft.
Begone, we have had enough of you. You shall not
enter the churches.' As soon as this harangue was
over, the monks capped it by roaring out: 'Heretic,
son of a Jew, apostate!' The troop having thus
fired their volley, hastily retreated within their
walls.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_438" id="Ref_438" href="#Foot_438">[438]</a></span></p>

<p>Some Bernese deputies, who chanced to be at
Neuchâtel, hearing what was going on at Grandson,
went thither without delay. They did not wish to
force the people to be converted, but they desired
that all under their rule should hear the gospel without
hindrance, and thus have liberty to decide with
full knowledge for Rome or for the Reformation.
When the Bernese lords arrived at Grandson, which
is not far from Neuchâtel, they ordered the conventual
churches to be thrown open to the reformers. A messenger
was sent to Farel, who returned immediately,
bringing Viret with him, and from the 12th May the
three evangelists began to preach Sundays and
week-days. The monks, surprised, irritated, and yet
restrained by fear of their dread lords, looked with
gloomy eyes on the crowd that came to hear the
<i>heresy</i>. The superior of the Gray Friars, who had a
great reputation for learning, thought himself called
upon to resist the reformers. They had hardly left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">{285}</a></span>
the pulpit when he entered it, and thus Farel and
Guy Regis attacked and refuted each other, struggling,
so to say, hand to hand. The evangelist preached
grace, the monk prescribed works; the former reproached
his opponent with disobeying Scripture, the
latter reproached the other with disobeying the Church.
The monks went further still: they conjured the
magistrates to come to the defence of the faith, and
the latter outlawed the ministers, while the sergeants
arrested them. The populace, seeing them in the hands
of the officers, followed them and covered them with
abuse, and they were shut up in prison.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_439" id="Ref_439" href="#Foot_439">[439]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the struggle descended to the people and
grew all the warmer. Parties were formed, bands
were organised. The catholics, in order to distinguish
themselves, stuck fir-cones in their caps, and thus
adorned stalked proudly through the streets. Their
adversaries said to them as they passed: 'You insult
Messieurs of Berne;' to which they arrogantly
answered: 'You shall not prevent us.'</p>

<p class="side">=REINFORCEMENT FROM YVERDUN.=</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Yverdun, a neighbouring town,
which eagerly espoused the cause defended by Guy
Regis, organised, not a troop of soldiers, but a procession.
It quitted the town and passed along the
shore of the lake; clerical banners instead of military
colours waved above their heads, sacred chants instead
of drums and trumpets filled the air. At last this
curious reinforcement reached the city where such a
fierce struggle was going on. The catholics no longer
doubted of victory. Men's minds grew heated and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">{286}</a></span>
their passions were inflamed. Farel and his friends,
having been set at liberty, a black friar named Claude
de Boneto stuck to the reformer and loaded him with
abuse. The latter undismayed said: 'Christians,
withdraw from the pope who has laid insupportable
burdens on your back, which he will not touch with
the tip of his finger. Come to Him who has taken all
your burden and placed it on his own shoulders. Do
not trust in the priests or in Rome. Have confidence
in Jesus Christ.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_440" id="Ref_440" href="#Foot_440">[440]</a></span>
The council of Berne took up the
defence of the evangelist, and condemned friar
Boneto.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_441" id="Ref_441" href="#Foot_441">[441]</a></span></p>

<p>As the support of Yverdun had produced no effect,
help was sent from Lausanne. On St. John's day (24th
June) a cordelier arrived at Grandson to preach in
honour of the saint. The church of the Franciscans
was soon crowded, and Farel and De Glautinis were
in the midst of the throng. The strange things which
the preacher said filled them with sorrow; presently
the reformer stood up, and (as was the custom of the
times) began to refute the monk. The latter stopped,
and the eyes of the assembly were turned upon the
minister with signs of anger. The bailiff, John Reyff
of Friburg, a good catholic, unable to restrain himself,
raised his hand and struck Farel. This was the
signal for a battle. Judges, gray friars, and burgesses
of Grandson, who had come armed to the
church, fell upon the two ministers, threw them to
the ground, and showered blows and kicks upon them.
Their friends hastened to their help, flung themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">{287}</a></span>
into the midst of the fray, and succeeded in rescuing
the reformers from the hands of the riotous crowd,
but not before they had been 'grievously maltreated
in the face and other parts.' The grand banneret of
Orbe saw it, and it is he who tells the story.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_442" id="Ref_442" href="#Foot_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE SENTINELS.=</p>

<p>The evangelicals lost no time: one of them started
off at once to see the Sieur de Watteville, the avoyer of
Berne, who chanced to be at his estate of Colombier,
three leagues from Grandson. That magistrate went to
the town, and wishing to put the inhabitants in a position
to exercise the right of free enquiry, according to
the principles of Berne, he ordered the cordelier and
Farel to preach by turns, and then went to the
church, attended by his servant, with the view of
hearing both preachers. But there was something
else to be done first. The people were still agitated
with the emotions of the preceding day, and pretended
that the reformers wanted to pull down the great
crucifix, which was much respected by all the city.
Two monks, Tissot and Gondoz, were distinguished
by their zeal for the doctrines of the pope; sincere but
fanatical, they would have thought they were doing
God a service by murdering Farel. They had been
posted as sentinels to defend the image supposed to be
threatened. Armed with axes hidden under their
frocks, they paced backwards and forwards, silent and
watchful, at the foot of the stairs which led to the
gallery where the famous crucifix stood. When the
Lord of Berne appeared, one of the sentinels, seeing
a strange face, which had an heretical look about it,
stopped him abruptly. 'Stand back, you cannot pass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">{288}</a></span>
this way,' he said, while his comrade rudely pushed
the Sieur de Watteville. 'Gently,' said the avoyer
in a grave tone; 'you should not get in such a heat.'
The patrician's serving-man, exasperated at this want
of respect to his master, and less calm than he was,
caught the cowled sentinel round the body, and feeling
the axe under his frock, took it away and was
about to strike him with it, when the Bernese lord
checked him. All the monks fled in alarm, and De
Watteville remaining master of the ground, placed
his servant there on guard. The latter, stalking up
and down with the axe on his shoulder, kept watch
instead of the monks.</p>

<p>He had been there only a few minutes, when about
thirty women, with flashing eyes and sullen air, each
holding her serge apron gathered up in front, made
their appearance and endeavoured to get into the
gallery. Some had filled their aprons with mould
from their gardens, and others with ashes from their
kitchens, and with these weapons they were marching
to battle. Their plan was not, indeed, to engage in a
regular fight, but to lie in ambush in the gallery near
the pulpit; and then as soon as Farel appeared, to
throw the ashes into his eyes and the earth into his
mouth, and so silence the fearless preacher of the
Gospel. This was their notion of controversy. The
troop approached: the avoyer's serving-man, firm as
became a servant of my lord of Berne, was still pacing
to and fro, axe in hand. He perceived the feminine
battalion, immediately saw what was their intention,
and advanced brandishing the weapon he had taken
from the monks. The devotees of Grandson, seeing
a Bernese instead of a gray friar, were alarmed; they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">{289}</a></span>
shrieked, let go their aprons, suffered the mould and
ashes to fall upon the floor of the church, and ran off
to their homes.</p>

<p class="side">=CONVERSION OF THE MONKS.=</p>

<p>The conspiracies of the monks and of the women
being thus baffled, the Bernese magistrate did not
take advantage of it to make Farel preach alone.
He wished the balance to be even. The gray friar
therefore and the reformer quietly took their turns.
Tissot and Gondoz, who had stopped De Watteville,
were imprisoned for a fortnight. The two monks, recovering
from their passion, began to consider what
this <i>Lutheran doctrine</i> could be which possessed such
stanch adherents. The reformers visited them, and
showed them much affection. The monks were
touched, they saw that the heresy of which they had
been so afraid was simply the all-merciful Gospel of
Jesus Christ. They left the prison with new thoughts,
and two years later, says the banneret, 'they received
the Lutheran law, were made preachers, one at Fontaines,
the other at Chavornay, married, and had a
large family of children.' In the days of the Reformation,
as in those of the apostles, it was often seen
that those who 'kicked against the pricks' obtained
mercy and became heralds of the faith.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_443" id="Ref_443" href="#Foot_443">[443]</a></span></p>

<p>A last tumult was to cause the principles of religious
liberty to be proclaimed in Switzerland. It
occurred at Orbe during the Christmas holidays. The
catholics, proud of the midnight devotions customary
among them at that season of the year, insulted the
reformed: 'Go to bed,' they said; 'while we are
singing the praises of God in the church you will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">{290}</a></span>
sleeping in your beds like swine.'... The reformers,
who did not like midnight masses with all their profanations,
desired to take advantage of the evening
hours, when the cessation of labour gave an opportunity
of collecting a large congregation. At seven
o'clock on Christmas eve they asked the governor for
the keys of the church: 'It is not sermon time,' he
answered, 'and you shall not have them.' They
rejoined that every hour, except at night, was sermon
time; and being determined to begin the evening services,
they went to the church, opened the doors, the
preacher got up into the pulpit, and in a moment the
place was crowded. A few priests or bigots, peeping
into the building, exclaimed in surprise at the
crowd: 'The devil must have sent a good many
there!' The minister (it may have been Viret) explained
the great mystery of faith, the coming of the
Saviour, and asked his hearers if they would not
receive him into their hearts. The sermon had lasted
some time, and the clock struck nine. Immediately
the bells rang, and the catholics crowded into the
church, although there was no service at that hour.</p>

<p>The reformed, being unwilling to quarrel, retired
home quietly; but a mischievous fellow, who had crept
into the assembly with the intention of exciting the
people, began to whisper to his neighbours that the
heretics were going to destroy everything at St. Claire.
This was false, but they believed it; the crowd deserted
the altars, and, meeting with a few reformers in the
streets, knocked some down, and broke the heads of
others; the best known among them had already
reached home, but the catholic population assembled
in front of their houses, and threw stones at their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">{291}</a></span>
windows. Viret departed for Berne with ten of the
reformed, in order to make his complaint.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_444" id="Ref_444" href="#Foot_444">[444]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=FIRST ACT OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.=</p>

<p>A few days later, on the 9th January 1532, two
hundred and thirty ministers assembled at Berne,
among whom was the wise Capito, and formed a sort of
council. Having most of them left the Romish church,
they desired liberty not only for themselves, but also
for their adversaries. The laymen were of the same
opinion. Berne, the representative of protestantism,
agreed with Friburg, the champion of popery, on this
subject. 'We desire,' said the Bernese, 'that every
one should have free choice to go to the preaching or
to mass.' 'And we also,' said the Friburgers. 'We
desire that all should live in peace together, and that
neither priests nor preachers should call their adversaries
heretics or murderers. 'And we also,' said
the Friburgers. 'Nevertheless, we do not wish to
hinder the priests and preachers from conferring amicably
and fraternally concerning the faith.' 'Quite
right,' said the Friburgers. These articles, and others
like them—the first monument of religious liberty in
Switzerland—were published on the 30th January 1532.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_445" id="Ref_445" href="#Foot_445">[445]</a></span>
It is to be regretted that this proclamation
of the sixteenth century was not henceforward taken
as a pattern in all christian countries, and in Switzerland,
where it was drawn up. The order did not for
long prevent violent collisions.</p>

<p>We shall now leave this quarter, and follow elsewhere
the great champion of the Word of God, Farel;
but we shall return here later. The evangelical seed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">{292}</a></span>
was to be sown still more abundantly in the Pays de
Vaud, and that soil, which appeared adverse at first,
will produce and has produced, in our days especially,
the finest of fruits.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER V.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">THE WALDENSES APPEAR.<br />
 (<span class="smc">1526 to October 1532.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON Friday, 12th July, Farel came from Morat to
Grandson, where a quiet conference was to be held.
Four disciples of the Gospel begged to receive the imposition
of hands. Farel and his colleagues examined
them, and, finding them fitted for the evangelical
work, sent them to announce the Gospel in the neighbouring
villages of Gy, Fy, Montagny, Noville, Bonvillars,
St. Maurice, Champagne, and Concise. But
the conference was to be occupied with more important
business.</p>

<p class="side">=THE WALDENSES.=</p>

<p>For two or three years past a strange report had circulated
among the infant churches that were forming
between the Alps and the Jura. They heard talk of
christians who belonged to the Reformation without
having ever been reformed. It was said that in some
of the remote valleys of the Alps of Piedmont and
Dauphiny, and in certain parts of Calabria, Apulia,
Provence, Lorraine, and other countries,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_446" id="Ref_446" href="#Foot_446">[446]</a></span>
there were believers who for many centuries had resisted the pope
and recognised no other authority than Holy Scripture.
Some called them 'Waldenses,' others 'poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">{294}</a></span>
men of Lyons,' and others 'Lutherans.' The report
of the victories of the Reformation having penetrated
their valleys, these pious men had listened to them
attentively; one of them in particular, Martin Gonin,
pastor of Angrogne, was seriously moved by them.
Being a man of decided and enterprising character,
and ready to give his life for the Gospel, the pious
<i>barbe</i> (the name given by the Waldenses to their
pastors) had felt a lively desire to go and see closely
what the Reformation was. This thought haunted
him everywhere: whether he traversed the little
glens which divided his valley, like a tree with its branches,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_447" id="Ref_447" href="#Foot_447">[447]</a></span>
or whether he followed the course of the
torrent, or sat at the foot of the Alps of Cella, Vachera,
and Infernet, Gonin sighed after Wittemberg and
Luther. At last he made up his mind; he departed
in 1526, found his way to the reformers, and brought
back into his valleys much good news and many pious
books. From that time the Reformation was the chief
topic of conversation among the barbes and shepherds
of those mountains.</p>

<p class="gap-above2">In 1530 many of them, threading the defiles of the
Alps, arrived on the French slopes, and following the
picturesque banks of the Durance, took their way towards
Merindol, where a synod of Waldensian christians
had been convened. They walked on, animated with
the liveliest joy; they had thought themselves alone,
and in one day there had been born to them in Europe
thousands of brethren who listened humbly to the
Word of God, and made the pope tremble on his throne....
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">{295}</a></span>
They spoke of the Reformation, of Luther,
and Melanchthon, and of the Swiss as they descended
the rough mountain paths. When the synod was formed,
they resolved to send a deputation to the evangelicals
of Switzerland, to show them that the Waldensian
doctrines were similar to those of the reformers, and
to prevail upon the latter to give them the hand of
fellowship. In consequence, two of them, George Morel
and Peter Masson, set out for Basle.</p>

<p class="side">=DEPUTATION TO ŒCOLAMPADIUS.=</p>

<p>On their arrival in that city, they asked for the house
of Œcolampadius; they entered his study, and the old
times, represented by these simple-minded worthy
barbes, greeted the new times in the person of the
amiable and steadfast reformer. The latter could not
see these brave and rustic men standing before him
and not feel an emotion of respect and sympathy. The
Waldenses took from their bosoms the documents of
their faith, and presented them to the pious doctor.
'Turning away from Antichrist,' said these papers,
and Masson and Morel repeated the words, 'we turn
towards Christ. He is our life, our truth, our peace,
our righteousness, our shepherd, our advocate, our
victim, our high-priest, who died for the salvation of believers.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_448" id="Ref_448" href="#Foot_448">[448]</a></span>
But alas! as smoke goeth before the fire,
the temptation of Antichrist precedeth the glory.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_449" id="Ref_449" href="#Foot_449">[449]</a></span>
In the time of the apostles Antichrist was but a child; he
has now grown into a perfect man. He robs Christ
of the merit of salvation, and ascribes it to his own
works. He strips the Holy Ghost of the power of
regeneration, and attributes it to his ceremonies. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">{296}</a></span>
leads the people to mass, a sad tissue of jewish, pagan,
and christian rites, and deprives them of the spiritual
and sacramental manducation.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_450" id="Ref_450" href="#Foot_450">[450]</a></span>
He hates, persecutes,
accuses, robs, and kills the members of Jesus Christ.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_451" id="Ref_451" href="#Foot_451">[451]</a></span>
He boasts of his length of life, of his monks,
his virgins, his miracles, his fasts, and his vigils, and
uses them as a cloak to hide his wickedness. Nevertheless,
the rebel is growing old and decreasing, and
the Lord is killing the felon by the breath of his mouth.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_452" id="Ref_452" href="#Foot_452">[452]</a></span>
Œcolampadius admired the simplicity of their
creed. He would not have liked a doctrine without
life, or an apparent life without doctrine, but he found
both in the Waldensian barbes. 'I thank God,' he
told them, 'that he has called you to so great light.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_453" id="Ref_453" href="#Foot_453">[453]</a></span></p>

<p>Ere long the doctors and faithful ones of Basle
desired to see these men of the ancient times. Seated
round the domestic hearth, the Waldenses narrated
the sufferings of their fathers, and described their
flocks scattered over the two slopes of the Alps.
'Some people,' they said, 'ascribe our origin to a
wealthy citizen of Lyons, Peter de Vaux or Waldo,
who, being at a banquet with his friends, saw one of
them suddenly fall dead.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_454" id="Ref_454" href="#Foot_454">[454]</a></span>
Moved and troubled in his
conscience he prayed to Jesus, sold his goods, and
began to preach and sent others to preach the Gospel everywhere.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_455" id="Ref_455" href="#Foot_455">[455]</a></span>
But,' added the barbes, 'we descend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">{297}</a></span>
from more ancient times, from the time when Constantine
introducing the world into the Church, our fathers
set themselves apart, or even from the time of the
apostles.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_456" id="Ref_456" href="#Foot_456">[456]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=CONFESSIONS OF THE BARBES.=</p>

<p>In the course of conversation, however, with these
brethren, the christians of Basle noticed certain points
of doctrine which did not seem conformable with
evangelical truth, and a certain uneasiness succeeded
to their former joy. Wishing to be enlightened,
Œcolampadius addressed a few questions to the two
barbes. 'All our ministers,' they answered on the
first point, 'live in celibacy, and work at some honest
trade.' 'Marriage, however,' said Œcolampadius, 'is
a state very becoming to all true believers, and particularly
to those who ought to be in all things <i>ensamples
to the flock</i>. We also think,' he continued,
'that pastors ought not to devote to manual labour,
as yours do, the time they could better employ in the
study of scripture. The minister has many things to
learn; God does not teach us miraculously and without
labour; we must take pains in order to know.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_457" id="Ref_457" href="#Foot_457">[457]</a></span></p>

<p>The barbes were at first a little confused at seeing
that the elders had to learn of their juniors; however,
they were humble and sincere men, and the Basle
doctor having questioned them on the sacraments,
they confessed that through weakness and fear they
had their children baptised by Romish priests, and
that they even communicated with them and sometimes
attended mass. This unexpected avowal startled
the meek Œcolampadius. 'What,' said he, 'has not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">{298}</a></span>
Christ, the holy victim, fully satisfied the everlasting
justice for us? Is there any need to offer other
sacrifices after that of Golgotha? By saying <i>Amen</i> to
the priests' mass you deny the grace of Jesus Christ.'</p>

<p>Œcolampadius next spoke of the strength of man
after the fall. 'We believe,' said the barbes modestly,
'that all men have some natural virtue, just as herbs,
plants, and stones have.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_458" id="Ref_458" href="#Foot_458">[458]</a></span>
'We believe,' said the
reformer, 'that those who obey the commandments of
God do so, not because they have more strength than
others, but because of the great power of the Spirit of
God which renews their will.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_459" id="Ref_459" href="#Foot_459">[459]</a></span>
'Ah,' said the barbes,
who did not feel themselves in harmony with the
reformers on this point, 'nothing troubles us weak
people so much as what we have heard of Luther's
teaching relative to free-will and predestination....
Our ignorance is the cause of our doubts: pray
instruct us.'</p>

<p>The charitable Œcolampadius did not think the
differences were such as ought to alienate him from
the barbes. 'We must enlighten these christians,' he
said, 'but above all things we must love them.' Had
they not the same Bible and the same Saviour as the
children of the Reformation? Had they not preserved
the essential truths of the faith from the primitive
times? Œcolampadius and his friends agitated
by this reflection, gave their hands to the Waldensian
deputation: 'Christ,' said the pious doctor,' is in
you as he is in us, and we love you as brethren.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">{299}</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE MARTYRED BARBE.=</p>

<p>The two barbes left Basle and proceeded to Strasburg
to confer with Bucer and Capito, after which
they prepared to return to their valleys. As Peter
Masson was of Burgundian origin, they determined to
pass through Dijon, a journey not unattended with
danger. It was said here and there in cloisters and
in bishops' palaces that the old heretics had come to
an understanding with the new. The pious conversation
of the two Waldensians having attracted the
attention of certain inhabitants of Dijon, a clerical and
fanatical city, they were thrown into prison. What
shall they do? What, they ask, will become of the
letters and instructions they are bearing to their co-religionists?
One of them, Morel, the bearer of this
precious trust, succeeded in escaping: Masson, who
was left, paid for both; he was condemned, executed,
and died with the peace of a believer.</p>

<p>When they saw only one of their deputation appear,
the Waldenses comprehended the dangers to which
the brethren had been exposed, and wept for Masson.
But the news of the reformers' welcome spread great
joy among them, in Provence, Dauphiny, in the valleys
of the Alps, and even to Apulia and Calabria.
The observations, however, of Œcolampadius, and his
demand for a stricter reform, were supported by some
and rejected by others. The Waldensians determined
therefore to take another step: 'Let us convoke a
synod of all our churches,' said they, 'and invite the
reformers to it.'</p>

<p>One July day in 1532, when Farel was at Grandson,
as we have seen, in conference with other ministers,
he was told that two individuals, whose foreign look
indicated that they came from a distance, desired to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">{300}</a></span>
speak with him. Two barbes, one from Calabria,
named George, the other Martin Gonin, a Piedmontese,
entered the room. After saluting the evangelicals
in the name of their brethren, they told
them that the demand that had been addressed to
them to separate entirely from Rome had caused division
among them. 'Come,' they said to the ministers
assembled at Grandson, 'come to the synod and explain
your views on this important point. After that
we must come to an understanding about the means
of propagating over the world the doctrine of the
Gospel which is common to both of us.' No message
could be more agreeable to Farel; and as these two
points were continually occupying his thoughts, he
determined to comply with the request of the
Waldensian brethren. His fellow-countryman, the
pious Saunier, wished to share his dangers.</p>

<p>The members of the conference and the evangelicals
of Grandson gazed with respect upon these ancient
witnesses of the truth, arriving among them from the
farther slopes of the Alps and the extremity of Italy,
where they would have had no idea of going to look
for brethren. They crowded round them and gave
them a welcome, overflowing with love for them as
they thought of the long fidelity and cruel sufferings
of their ancestors. They listened with interest to
the story of the persecutions endured by their fathers,
and the heroism with which the Waldenses had endured
them. They were all ears when they were told
how the barbes and their flocks were suddenly attacked
by armed bands in their snowy mountains during the
festival of Christmas in the year 1400; how men,
women, and children had been compelled to flee over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">{301}</a></span>
the rugged rocks, and how many of them had perished
of cold and hunger, or had fallen by the sword. In
one place the bodies of fourscore little children were
found frozen to death in the stiffened arms of their
mothers who had died with them.... In another
place thousands of fugitives who had taken refuge in
deep caverns (1488) had been suffocated by the fires
which their cruel persecutors had kindled at the entrance
of their hiding-place.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_460" id="Ref_460" href="#Foot_460">[460]</a></span>
Would not the Reformation
regard these martyrs as its precursors? Was
it not a privilege for it thus to unite with the witnesses
who had given glory to Jesus Christ since the first
ages of the Church?</p>

<p class="side">=FAREL'S DANGEROUS JOURNEY.=</p>

<p>Some of the Swiss christians were alarmed at the idea
of Farel's journey. In truth great dangers threatened
the reformer. The martyrdom of Peter Masson, sacrificed
two years before, had exasperated the Waldenses
of Provence, and their lamentations had aroused the
anger of their enemies. The bishops of Sisteron,
Apt, and Cavaillon had taken counsel together and
laid a remonstrance before the parliament of Aix,
which had immediately ordered a raid to be made on
the heretics: the prisons were filled with Waldensians
and Lutherans, real or pretended. Martin Gonin, one
of the two Waldensian deputies, was in a subsequent
journey arrested at Grenoble, put into a sack, and
drowned in the Isère. A similar fate might easily
happen to Farel. Did not the country he would have
to cross depend on the duke of Savoy, and had not
Bellegarde and Challans laid hands on Bonivard in a
country less favourable to ambuscades than that which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">{302}</a></span>
Farel had to pass through? That mattered not: he
did not hesitate. He will leave these quarters where
the might of Berne protects him and pass through the
midst of his enemies. 'There was in him the same
zeal as in his Master,' says an historian;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_461" id="Ref_461" href="#Foot_461">[461]</a></span>
'like the Saviour, he feared neither the hatred of the Pharisees,
nor the cunning of Herod, nor the rage of the people.'
He made every preparation for his departure, and
Saunier did the same.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_462" id="Ref_462" href="#Foot_462">[462]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as Farel was about to leave Switzerland, he
received unpleasant tidings from France, and thus
found himself solicited on both sides. He wrote to
his fellow-countrymen one of those letters, so full of
consolation and wisdom, which characterise our reformers.
'Men look fiercely at you,' he said, 'and
threaten you, and lay heavy fines upon you; your
friends turn their robes and become your enemies....
All men distress you.... Observing all
modesty, meekness, and friendship, persevering in holy
prayers, living purely, and helping the poor, commit
everything to the Father of mercies, by whose aid
you will walk, strong and unwearied, in all truth.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_463" id="Ref_463" href="#Foot_463">[463]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=FAREL'S ARRIVAL IN THE VALLEYS.=</p>

<p>Towards the end of August, Farel and Saunier took
leave of the brethren around them, got on their horses,
and departed. Their course was enveloped in mystery:
they avoided the places where they might be known
and traversed uninhabited districts. Having crossed
the Alps and passed through Pignerol, they fixed their
eyes, beaming with mournful interest, on the lonely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">{303}</a></span>
places where almost inaccessible caverns, pierced in the
ragged sides of the mountains, often formed the only
temple of the Christians, and where every rock had a
history of persecution and martyrdom. Their place
of meeting was Angrogne, in the parish of the pious
Martin Gonin. The two reformers quitted La Tour,
and following the sinuosities of the torrent, and turning
the precipices, they arrived at the foot of a magnificent
forest, and then reached a vast plateau abounding in
pastures: this was the Val d'Angrogne. They gazed
upon the steep ranges of the Soirnan and Infernet, the
pyramidal flanks of mount Vandalin, and the gentler
slopes upon which stood the lowly hamlets of the
valley. They found Waldenses here and there in the
meadows and at the foot of the rocks; some were
prepared 'to be a guard for the ministers of the good
law;' and all looked with astonishment and joy at the
pastors who came from Switzerland. 'That one with
the red beard and riding the white horse is Farel,' said
John Peyret of Angrogne, one of their escort, to his
companions; 'the other on the dark horse is Saunier.'
'There was also a third,' add the eye-witnesses, 'a tall
man and rather lame:' he may have been a Waldensian
who had acted as a guide to the two deputies.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_464" id="Ref_464" href="#Foot_464">[464]</a></span>
Other foreign Christians met in this remote valley
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">{304}</a></span>
of the Alps. There were some from the southern
extremity of Italy, from Burgundy, Lorraine, Bohemia,
and countries nearer home. There was also
a certain number of persons of more distinguished
appearance: the lords of Rive Noble, Mirandola, and
Solaro had quitted their castles to take part in this
Alpine council. Clergy, senate, and people were thus
assembled; and as no room could have held the number,
it was resolved to meet in the open air. Gonin
selected for this purpose the hamlet of Chanforans,
where there is now only one solitary house. There, in
a shady spot, on the side of the mountain, surrounded
by an amphitheatre of rugged cliffs and distant peaks,
the barbe had arranged the rude benches on which the
members of this Christian assembly were to sit.</p>

<p>Two parties met there face to face. At the head
of that which was unwilling to break entirely with the
Roman Catholic Church were two barbes, Daniel of
Valence and John of Molines, who struggled for the
success of their system of accommodation and compliance.
On the other hand Farel and Saunier supported
the evangelical party, who had not such distinguished
representatives as the traditional party, and proposed
the definitive rejection of all semi-catholic doctrines
and usages. Before the opening of the synod the two
ministers, finding themselves surrounded by numbers
of the brethren, both in their homes and under the shade
of the trees where the assembly was to be held, had
already explained to them the faith of the Reformation,
and several of the Waldenses had exclaimed that it was
the doctrine taught from father to son among them, and
to which they were resolved to adhere. Yet the issue
of the combat appeared doubtful; for the semi-catholic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">{305}</a></span>
party was strong, and described the reformers as
foreigners and innovators who had come there to alter
their ancient doctrines. But Farel had good hopes,
for he could appeal to Holy Scripture and even to the
confessions of the Waldenses themselves.</p>

<p class="side">=OPENING OF THE SYNOD.=</p>

<p>On the 12th September the synod was opened 'in the
name of God.' One party looked with favour on Farel
and Saunier, the other on John of Molines and Daniel
of Valence; but the majority appeared to be on the
side of the Reformation. Farel rose and boldly
broached the question: he contended that there was
no longer any ceremonial law, that no act of worship
had any merit of itself, and that a multitude of feasts,
dedications, rites, chants, and mechanical prayers
was a great evil. He reminded them that Christian
worship consists essentially in faith in the Gospel, in
charity, and in the confession of Christ. '<i>God is a
spirit</i>,' he said, 'and divine worship should be performed
<i>in spirit and in truth</i>.' The two barbes strove
in vain to oppose these views, the meeting testified
their assent to them. Did not their confession reject
'all feasts, vigils of saints, water called holy, the act
of abstaining from flesh, and other like things invented by men?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_465" id="Ref_465" href="#Foot_465">[465]</a></span>
The worship in spirit was proclaimed.</p>

<p>Farel, delighted at this first victory, desired to win
another and perhaps more difficult one. He believed
that it was by means of the doctrine of the natural
power of man that popery took salvation out of the
hands of God and put it into the hands of the priests:
'God,' said he, 'has elected before the foundation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">{306}</a></span>
the world all those who have been or who will be saved.
It is impossible for those who have been ordained to
salvation not to be saved. Whosoever upholds free-will,
absolutely denies the grace of God.' This was a
point which Molines and his friend resisted with all
their might. But did not the Waldensian confessions
recognise the impotency of man and the all-sufficiency
of grace? Did not they call the denial of these things
'the work of Antichrist?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_466" id="Ref_466" href="#Foot_466">[466]</a></span>
Farel moreover adduced
proof from Scripture. The synod was at first in suspense,
but finally decided that it recognised this article
as 'conformable with Holy Scripture.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_467" id="Ref_467" href="#Foot_467">[467]</a></span></p>

<p>Certain questions of morality anxiously occupied
the reformer. In his opinion the Romish Church had
turned everything topsy-turvy, calling those works
<i>good</i> which she prescribed though they had nothing good
in them, and those <i>bad</i> which were in conformity with
the will of God. 'There is no good work but that
which God has commanded,' said Farel, 'and none
bad but what He has forbidden.' The assembly
expressed their entire assent.</p>

<p class="side">=FAREL'S OPINIONS GAIN GROUND.=</p>

<p>Then continuing the struggle, the firm evangelical
doctor successively maintained that the true confession
of a Christian is to confess to God alone; that marriage
is forbidden to no man, whatever his condition;
that Scripture determines only two sacraments, baptism
and the Lord's Supper; that Christians may
swear in God's name and fill the office of magistrate;
and finally, that they should lay aside their manual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">{307}</a></span>
occupations on Sunday in order to have leisure to
praise God, exercise charity, and listen to the truths
of Scripture.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_468" id="Ref_468" href="#Foot_468">[468]</a></span>
'Yes, that is it,' said the delighted
Waldenses, 'that is the doctrine of our fathers.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_469" id="Ref_469" href="#Foot_469">[469]</a></span></p>

<p>Molines and Daniel of Valence did not, however,
consider their cause lost. Ought not the fear of
persecution to induce the Waldenses to persevere in
certain dissimulations calculated to secure them from
the inquisitive eyes of the enemies of the faith?
Nothing displeased the reformers so much as dissembling.
'Let us put off that paint,' said Calvin,
'by which the Gospel is disfigured, and let us not
endeavour slavishly to please our adversaries; let us
go boldly to work. If we permit compromises in
some practices the whole doctrine will fall, and the
building be thrown down.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_470" id="Ref_470" href="#Foot_470">[470]</a></span>
Farel thought as Calvin
did. Perceiving this loophole for the two barbes, he
urged the necessity of a frank confession of the truth.
The members of the assembly, pricked in their consciences
by the remembrance of their former backslidings,
bound themselves to take no part henceforward
in any Romish superstition, and to recognise as
their pastor no priest of the pope's church. 'We
will perform our worship,' they said, 'openly and
publicly to give glory to God.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_470a" id="Ref_470a" href="#Foot_470">[470]</a></span></p>

<p>The two barbes, who were no doubt sincere, became
more eloquent. The moment was come that was to
decide the future. In their opinion, by establishing
new principles they cast discredit on the men who had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">{308}</a></span>
hitherto directed the churches. No doubt it was
culpable to take part in certain ceremonies with an
unworthy object, but was it so when it was done for
good ends? To break entirely with the Catholic
Church would render the existence of the Waldenses
impossible, or at least would provoke hostilities which
would reduce them completely to silence....
Farel replied with wonderful energy maintaining the
rights of truth. He showed them that every compromise
with error is a lie. The purity of the doctrine
he professed, his elevated thoughts, the ardent affection
expressed by his voice, his gestures, and his looks,
electrified the Waldenses, and poured into their souls
the holy fire with which his own was burning. These
witnesses of the middle ages called to mind how the
children of Israel having adopted the customs of
people alien to the covenant of God, wept abundantly
and exclaimed: '<i>We have trespassed against God!</i>'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_471" id="Ref_471" href="#Foot_471">[471]</a></span>
The Waldenses felt like them, and desired to make
amends for their sins. They drew up a brief confession
in 17 articles, in conformity with the resolutions
that had been adopted, and then said: 'We adhere
with one accord to the present declaration, and we pray
God that, of his great charity, nothing may divide us
henceforward, and that, even when separated from one
another, we may always remain united in the same
spirit.' Then they signed their names.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_472" id="Ref_472" href="#Foot_472">[472]</a></span></p>

<p>The agreement was not however universal. During
the six days' discussion several barbes and laymen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">{309}</a></span>
might have been seen standing apart, in some shady
place, with gloomy air and uneasy look, talking together
on the resolutions proposed to the synod. At
the moment when every one was affixing his signature
to the confession, the two leaders withheld theirs, and
withdrew from the assembly.</p>

<p class="side">=OLD WALDENSIAN MANUSCRIPTS.=</p>

<p>During the discussion, and even before it, Farel
and Saunier had had several conversations and conferences
with the Waldenses, in the course of which the
barbes had displayed their old manuscripts, handed
down from the twelfth century, as they said: the
<i>Noble Lesson</i>, the <i>Ancient Catechism</i>, the <i>Antichrist</i>, the
<i>Purgatory</i>, and others. These writings bore the date of
A.D. 1120, which probably was not disputed by Farel.
One line of the <i>Noble Lesson</i> seems to indicate this as
the period when it was composed.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_473" id="Ref_473" href="#Foot_473">[473]</a></span>
Since then, however,
more recent dates have been assigned to the
other writings, especially to the <i>Antichrist</i>, and even to
the <i>Noble Lesson</i>. In any case, however, these documents
belong to a time anterior to the Reformation.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_474" id="Ref_474" href="#Foot_474">[474]</a></span>
The Waldensians displayed with peculiar pride several
manuscript copies of the Old and New Testament in the
vulgar tongue. 'These books,' they said, 'were copied
correctly by hand so long ago as to be beyond memory,
and are to be seen in many families.' Farel and Saunier
had received and handled these writings with emotion;
they had turned over the leaves, and 'marvelling at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">{310}</a></span>
the heavenly favour accorded to so small a people,'
had rendered thanks to the Lord because the Bible
had never been taken from them.</p>

<p>They did not stop there: Farel addressing the
synod, represented to them that the copies being few
in number they could only serve for a few persons:
'Ah!' said he, 'if there are so many sects and heresies,
so much trouble and confusion now in the world, it all
comes from ignorance of the Word of God. It would
therefore be exceedingly necessary for the honour of
God and the well-being of all christians who know the
French language, and for the destruction of all doctrines
repugnant to the truth, to translate the Bible
from the Hebrew and Greek tongues into French.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_475" id="Ref_475" href="#Foot_475">[475]</a></span></p>

<p>No proposal could be more welcome to the Waldenses;
their existence was due to their love of
Scripture, and all their treatises and poems celebrated
it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">

<div class="verse">The Scriptures speak and we must believe.</div>
<div class="verse">Look at the Scriptures from beginning to end.<span
     class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_476" id="Ref_476" href="#Foot_476">[476]</a></span>
</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus spoke the <i>Noble Lesson</i>. They agreed 'joyfully
and with good heart to Farel's demand, busying and
exerting themselves to carry out the undertaking.'
The proposition was voted enthusiastically, and the
delighted reformers looked with emotion and joy at
this faithful and constant people, to whom God had
entrusted for so many ages the ark of the new covenant,
and who were now inspired with fresh zeal for
his service.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_477" id="Ref_477" href="#Foot_477">[477]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">{311}</a></div>

<p>The hour had come for them to separate. John of
Molines and Daniel of Valence went to Bohemia, and
joined the Waldenses of that country; the pastors
returned to their churches, the shepherds to their
mountains, and the lords to their castles. Farel
mounted his white horse, Saunier his black one;
they shook hands with the Waldenses who surrounded
them, and descending from Angrogne to La Tour,
bade adieu to the valleys.</p>

<p class="side">=FAREL'S VIEWS ON GENEVA.=</p>

<p>Where should they go? What would be the next
work undertaken by Farel?... Geneva had long
occupied his thoughts, and as he crossed the Alps he
had before him in spirit that city with its wants and
its inhabitants, especially those who were beginning to
'meditate on Jesus Christ.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_478" id="Ref_478" href="#Foot_478">[478]</a></span>
Already, before his departure
for Italy, Farel had conceived the plan of
stopping at Geneva on his return, and with that intent
had even received from my lords of Berne some letters
of introduction addressed to the leading Huguenots.
'I will go to them now,' he said, 'I will speak to them,
even if there is nobody that will hear me.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_479" id="Ref_479" href="#Foot_479">[479]</a></span></p>

<p>This idea, which never quitted him, was the beginning
of the Reformation of Geneva.</p>

Gilles, p. 40. Monastier, i. p. 201. We learn from the <i>Apologie
du translateur</i> at the beginning of Olivetan's Bible (1535) that
Olivetan did not go into the valleys as some have believed; he speaks of
two deputies only under the pseudonyms of <i>Hilerme Cusemeth</i>
(Guillaume Farel) and <i>Antoine Almeutes</i> ([Greek: almeutês],
salter, Saunier). As for the third, whom he calls <i>Cephas
Chlorotes</i>, if he addressed the <i>Apologie</i> to him also, it was
not because he had been to Angrogne, but because he had joined the other
two in asking him to undertake that edition of the Bible. This Cephas
Chlorotes is evidently Peter Viret ([Greek: chlôros], virens).</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">JUST when the Gospel was about to enter Geneva
with Farel and Saunier, the bishop-prince was
making new exertions to recover his power. A crisis
was approaching: a decisive step must be taken. Which
shall have supremacy in the church—the bulls of the
pope or the Scriptures of God? Which shall have
supremacy in the state—slavery or liberty? Great
powers had determined to oppress this little city; but
humble servants of God were about to enter it one
after another, and planting there the standard of
Christ, secure the victory to independence and the
Gospel.</p>

<p class="side">=BELLEGARDE'S AUDIENCE WITH CHARLES.=</p>

<p>The Duke of Savoy, desiring to inflict a fatal
blow on Geneva, had invoked the co-operation of the
most powerful monarchs of Europe, and despatched
to Charles V., then at the diet of Augsburg, the
usual minister of his tyranny, the man whom he
had employed to put Levrier to death, and to capture
Bonivard. As soon as Bellegarde reached
Augsburg (11th September 1530) he waited on the
Sire de Montfalconet, who at that time discharged
the office of grand equerry to His Majesty, and who
'had great credit with the emperor, so that, nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">{313}</a></span>
was kept secret from him.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_480" id="Ref_480" href="#Foot_480">[480]</a></span>
Enemies whom the
duke had at the imperial court had created a very
unfavourable impression of this prince; Bellegarde
accordingly gave a pension of 300 crowns to the
equerry, who earnt them under the circumstances we
are describing, by following the envoy's instructions.
The latter, being impatient to draw the emperor into
the plans concocted for seizing Geneva, begged Montfalconet
to ask his master at what hour he would be
pleased 'to permit him to pay his respects.' 'Tell
him,' said Charles, who had on his hands all the affairs
of protestantism and Germany, 'tell him that in consequence
of my many engagements he must wait a
couple of days.' Bellegarde did so, and on the third
morning attended punctually in the emperor's chamber.
Very impatient to see the puissant monarch, he
was rehearsing what he had to tell him about Geneva,
when instead of His Majesty he saw Montfalconet
enter the room alone with this message: 'The emperor
desires me to say that for the present you must only
hand in his highness's letter, as well as that from his
most dread lady; and he will give you an audience
directly after.' The ambassador was much vexed at
the delay; but to console him the equerry confidentially
informed him of the great trouble the protestants
of Germany were giving Charles. 'I assure you the
emperor is in such a condition,' he said, 'that it is impossible
for him to bring the affairs of the empire into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">{314}</a></span>
anything like a reasonable state. He has therefore
forsaken the counsels of men to have recourse to the
Lord only. As the <i>help</i> of the world fails me, said
His Majesty this morning (14th September), I hope
Divine Providence will come to my assistance. The
emperor then confessed, and retired into the oratory
of the palace to receive the sacrament. He has also
ordered that prestations (confessions, communions,
and prayers) should be made in every place where
there are any devout people.'</p>

<p>While these two individuals were talking Charles
came out of his oratory. M. de Bellegarde made him
a low bow, humbly presented him the compliments of
the duke and duchess, and handed him the letters.
The emperor, who was busy, told him to return the
next morning at his levée. Bellegarde did not fail,
and Charles received him with much kindness. 'Give
me news of his highness's health,' he said, 'and also of
madam my good sister (Duchess Beatrice), and of my
nephew monsieur their son.' Bellegarde answered his
questions, and then made all the communications to
the emperor with which the duke had charged him.
He hoped the emperor would immediately enter into
conversation with him about the plans formed against
Geneva, but it was not so. 'I am very glad,' said
Charles, 'that the duke has sent you to me; but, considering
my great occupations, be so good as to draw
up a memoir of what you think most expedient for the
despatch of the business that brings you here, and then
deliver it to my lord Grandvelle.'</p>

<p>Here was a fresh delay. The minister's answer,
considering the numerous offices he filled, had to be
waited for; yet Bellegarde spoke seven times with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">{315}</a></span>
Charles V., 'each time giving his majesty some little
information about the duke's affairs.' But the emperor,
while appearing to listen to the disputes between
Geneva and Turin, frequently had his thoughts elsewhere.
He was tormented with the state of the empire,
and did not conceal it from his brother-in-law's envoy.
'I do not mean,' he said one day to Bellegarde, 'that
the duke shall be either dismissed or ejected; but the
diet (of Augsburg) is all in confusion and broken up.
I have no great hopes.... It is a long while since I
have found the princes of Germany thus dilly-dallying,
putting me off from day to day, so that I am quite out
of hope, and my head is confused.... Ah! if it pleased
God that other princes were of my opinion....
Christendom would not be in such confusion.' These
are the very words his majesty was pleased to use,
adds Bellegarde in his memoir. He was surprised at
them. That man who knew so well how to put one
of his adversaries in prison and another to death, was
astonished that so mighty a prince as Charles should
not adopt an equally simple and expeditious method.
He ventured to give the emperor a little advice. He
had learnt that the strength of the protestants was in
their union. 'Sire,' he said, 'break up the alliances,
as well past as future, which have been formed to your
great prejudice, and whose consequences are so dangerous.'—'At
present,' said Charles, 'there is no time.
I cannot now reduce the princes and cities of Germany
that are opposed to the faith; but I am determined not
to abandon the work, and when I have completed it,
what concerns his highness (be sure you tell him) will
not be forgotten.' This then was Charles's plan: first
to crush the protestants of Germany, and then the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">{316}</a></span>
huguenots of Geneva. In his opinion these were as
dangerous for the Latin races as the former for the
Germans.</p>

<p class="side">=THE EMPEROR'S ANSWER.=</p>

<p>At last, on the 6th October, Grandvelle, chancellor
of the empire (he was the father of the famous cardinal),
accompanied by the commander&nbsp;——,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_481" id="Ref_481" href="#Foot_481">[481]</a></span>
had an interview
with Bellegarde, and gave him the emperor's answer.
'With respect to Geneva, his majesty thinks that to
avoid falling into the danger which the duke has at
all times feared and avoided, no part or parcel of his
states must become Swiss. You must take all the
more precaution, because the nature of the cantons is
always to extend and grow larger, and the rebellion
and stiff-necked obstinacy of messieurs of Geneva will
incline them to plunge through despair into this
accursed error.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_482" id="Ref_482" href="#Foot_482">[482]</a></span>
That would cause loss and damage
to the duke, and little credit to the emperor, considering
that Geneva is a fief of the empire. Here is the
expedient the emperor has hit upon. He orders both
the duke and Geneva to lay before him within two
months their titles, rights, and privileges, and his
majesty will then decide. As for the prelates, the
bishop, and the canons, the emperor recommends both
them and the duke to bring their quarrels to an end.
By so doing the duke will get rid of a great load of
trouble, and will have the prelates better under his
direction and obedience.' After a few other communications,
the chancellor withdrew with the
commander, and Bellegarde immediately sent off a
despatch conveying this decision to the duke.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">{317}</a></div>

<p class="side">=BELLEGARDE'S LETTER.=</p>

<p>The Sieur de Bellegarde left Augsburg not long
after, and returned to Turin, determined to urge his
master more than ever to destroy independence and
the Reformation in Geneva at one blow. What he
had seen at Augsburg, and the dangers with which
German protestantism threatened the supremacy of the
pope and of the emperor, had increased his zeal. The
institutions of the middle ages seem to have had at
that time no friend more fanatical and no champion
more zealous than the active, intelligent, devoted, cruel
courtier who had put Levrier to death at the castle of
Bonne. 'My lord,' he said to the duke, 'consider
the peril to which you are exposed in this business of
Geneva, either because of the neighbours who are so
near, and are ravening wolves, or because of the little
faith the world now has in all the qualities, sound
right, and reasons a man may have. What will happen
if we do not remain masters in the struggle with this
new sect? What vexations, losses, and cares, you
know that better than I do. They want to keep you in
good humour, my lord, but it is only the better to
make game of you, and to increase at your expense, on
this side of the mountains or on that—everywhere, in
fact. You have documents in your chamber to show
that the Genevans used to pay you toll and subsidy;
that they helped to portion the daughters of your
house; and, further, that they gave your predecessors
aid in time of war, and that in time of peace they appealed
to them in their suits and sentences.... And
now what have they done? They have deprived you of
the vidamy, they have taken from you the castle on the
island, they have committed much injustice to the prejudice
of your rights, and have been guilty of murder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">{318}</a></span>
and other intolerable evils.... Worse still ... they
are joining <i>that perverse sect</i> in order to complete their
ruin.</p>

<p class="side">=HIS PLANS AGAINST GENEVA.=</p>

<p>'But we shall soon put an end to it all, my lord.
You have an emperor at your service on whom everything
depends. Will they dare be wicked and rebellious
in his presence?... Firstly, the emperor will
replace them under your authority, as you and your
ancestors had them.... Next, for their rebellion and
the crimes they have committed, he will condemn them
to be deprived of some privilege—of that which is most
injurious to you. Finally, he will build for you, for
your government, a castle or fortress in the city, in
whatever part you like, and exact from the Genevans
for the support of the garrison a tax to be paid every
year. The city will thus be kept well in subjection.
As for the bishops, the emperor will command them to
pay you the respect which belongs to the holy empire,
as being its representative; he will order them to obey
you like himself, and will restore them to all obedience
towards you ... considering also that <i>the time approaches</i>
for their <i>general reformation, as is but reasonable</i>.
And if the said people of Geneva will not
obey (as their unreason may incline them) the emperor
will put them under the ban of the empire as rebels,
and you shall seize them.... <i>You will make them
your subjects entirely, confiscating all their privileges and
possessions</i>; and thus you will be for ever established
rightfully in Geneva.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_483" id="Ref_483" href="#Foot_483">[483]</a></span></p>

<p>We should not perhaps have quoted the words of
the Sieur de Bellegarde at such length, if the document
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">{319}</a></span>
from which they are extracted had not been hitherto
unknown. His allegations were false. No presents
had ever been made by the city of Geneva to the
dukes of Savoy without a special act declaring that the
liberality was spontaneous and without prejudice for
the future. The vidamy was a fief conferred by the
bishop, which made the holder of it an officer of the
latter. Lastly, the dukes of Savoy were not vicars of
the emperor. But if Bellegarde's allegations as to the
past were false, his schemes as to the future were
outrageous. A strong fortress shall be built in Geneva,
the citizens shall pay the garrison, and a brutal serfdom
shall withdraw them from that <i>perverse sect</i> and
keep them for ever in strict obedience under the yoke
of their master! As for the bishops, they shall be
compelled to obey the duke, especially as the time of
<i>their general reformation</i> approaches! It would appear,
then, that in the sixteenth century already <i>reason</i> (as
Bellegarde says) demanded the abolition of the temporal
power of ecclesiastical princes. Were they more
advanced then than in our days? I think not. This
rude policy aimed merely at substituting the despotism
of princes for the despotism of bishops, as being
stricter and more effectual. Lastly—the end crowns
the work—if the Genevans resist, they shall be conquered,
and all their power and property confiscated.
In this manner, concludes the advocate of these revolutionary
measures, the rights of his master will be for
ever secured. This is what Geneva had to expect
from Savoy; what had it to hope from the bishop?</p>

<p>Pierre de la Baume, indignant at the duke's pretensions,
had said to him one day proudly: 'I am subject
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">{320}</a></span>
only to the pope.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_484" id="Ref_484" href="#Foot_484">[484]</a></span>
He had lately softened down, in
appearance at least, and was drawing nearer to Savoy,
so that the Genevans said: 'Our prince is reconciled
with our enemy.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_485" id="Ref_485" href="#Foot_485">[485]</a></span>
We are now transported into
quite another sphere. If the duke wished to reign by
force, the bishop desired to use stratagem. The pastor
of Geneva was not in a position to build a fortress in
the middle of the city; it was by means of negotiations
and intrigues that he would crush the Reformation
and liberty. The lion was succeeded by the serpent.
Pierre de la Baume, knowing the influence Besançon
Hugues had over his fellow-citizens, solicited his
help. He wrote to him, during the last year of
Besançon's life, a series of letters we have also had
the good fortune to discover.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_486" id="Ref_486" href="#Foot_486">[486]</a></span>
The bishop and the
citizen of Geneva were not such good friends as they
had been. The former addressed many reproaches to
the latter, either because Hugues was dissatisfied on
political grounds, or perhaps because his catholicism
had cooled down a little in his frequent interviews
with the reformed of Berne.</p>

<p class="side">=THE BISHOP'S SECRETARY IN GENEVA.=</p>

<p>On the 11th of April 1532, the bishop, then at
Arbois, impatient to recover his former power in
Geneva, resolved to open the campaign, and wrote to
Hugues: 'Besançon, I have always done for you everything
that I could; you have seen it by the results; I
do not speak to reproach you, but I am astonished that
you should requite me so ill. If you had as good an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">{321}</a></span>
affection for me, as I have given you opportunity, you
would have <i>barked</i> (aboyé) so well, that my authority
would not have fallen to its present depression, and
I should not have the trouble, which I must take, of
restoring it. I well know the excuses that you can
make.... None is so deaf as he that will not hear.
Nevertheless I have trusted in you, and I still trust in
your well-known fidelity. So act, I pray, that I may
have cause to continue it. In a little time I shall send
one of my people to Geneva on business; you will
hear the rest from him. I pray God that He will give
you, Besançon, all that you desire.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_487" id="Ref_487" href="#Foot_487">[487]</a></span>
Ten days later, Machard, the bishop's secretary, came from Arbois to
Geneva, charged with a political mission, and bearer of
another letter for Hugues, which, either on account of
the delicate matters to which it related, or because
Machard was to explain them verbally, is rather obscure.
Hugues hastened to read the prelate's missive:
'I send my secretary,' said De la Baume, 'on certain
business, which I have instructed him to communicate
to you first. You will give credit to what he says in
my name as if I said it myself. I desire that the
affair in question may come to a good end, in order to
gratify the princes from whom it proceeds (the emperor
and the duke, no doubt). Set a willing hand
to it, so that there may be friendly relations between
me and my subjects and the said princes, which is a
thing of no trifling consequence to all the republic.'</p>

<p>Hugues did not care to enter into the plans formed
by the bishop in accord with the princes; so that when
Machard returned to Arbois and made his report, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">{322}</a></span>
master was much annoyed. He complained of the
excessive boldness and strange insubordination of
the Genevans, and wrote bitterly to the ex-syndic.
'Besançon,' he said, 'the news that you have given me
of Berne are a little compensation for the insolence
and ill practices that you and my subjects show
towards my officers, usurping my jurisdiction under
the shelter of certain words that you have uttered
before the general council.... I intend to uphold
this same jurisdiction in opposition to you.... Indeed
I have done so against greater folks.... I hope that
you will return to your duty and become my subjects
once more. That will give me the opportunity of
being a good master. Otherwise do not trust to me....
Matters shall not remain where you have left
them. Communicate this to my subjects, if need
be.'</p>

<p class="side">=THE BISHOP'S ANGER.=</p>

<p>The bishop was angry with Geneva, as this letter
shows—sometimes more, sometimes less, but always
restless and agitated. One day he was told of something
Hugues had said which delighted him; not long
after he would hear of something the Genevans had done
that increased his anger. About the 13th May when
he was informed that Hugues had displayed a very
good feeling towards him, the prelate was quite delighted,
and wrote to him: 'I have been informed of
your intention to declare everywhere the wrong that
my subjects are doing me. You will show me, I hope,
by good actions, when I shall require it of you, that
you are not a man of <i>two words</i>.' But ere long other
tidings reached the bishop. He was filled with trouble,
fear, and pain; and gave way to all the emotions of a
restless and suspicious policy. He had fits of anger;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">{323}</a></span>
he became rash, violent; then he would suddenly collapse;
he had neither strength, feeling, nor courage.
In general, however, it was indignation that prevailed
in him. Not one of his officers or of the canons (for
there was a collegiate church at Arbois) understood
him, or consoled him, or encouraged him. He was
alone ... and vented his agitation in his apartments
or in his gardens. 'I think the answers made by my
subjects very strange,' he said, 'I should be sorry to
be angry with them.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_488" id="Ref_488" href="#Foot_488">[488]</a></span>
A few days later he wrote:
'I am quite amazed.... It seems that my subjects
do not understand their business.... If they do not
mend, I shall be forced to proceed in another way ...
which will displease me.... It seems to me that they
would do well to obey their lord, and not act the
prince.... It cannot last.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_489" id="Ref_489" href="#Foot_489">[489]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=LETTER TO HUGUES.=</p>

<p>But it did last. Geneva, where they were listening
to Olivetan, where they were placarding everywhere,
by the side of the pardon of Rome, 'the great general
pardon' of Jesus Christ, where the council unanimously
ordered the Gospel to be preached 'according to the
truth, without any mixture of fable;'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_490" id="Ref_490" href="#Foot_490">[490]</a></span>—Geneva,
whatever Pierre de la Baume might say or do, was separating
from the bishop and the pope. On the 3d September
(1532), the bishop, more exasperated than ever, wrote
again to Besançon Hugues, but with an increase of
ill-humour. 'I am displeased with the way my subjects
treat me from day to day, declaring that they
will rise against my authority.... That will last as
long as it can.... I have always been long-suffering;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">{324}</a></span>
but now it would be better for me to be angry....
If I attempt to do anything from which the Genevans
will reap neither pleasure nor profit ... they must
not be surprised.... Certainly I have little to
thank my servants or my friends for serving me so
badly.... I think, Besançon, that you desire what
is right, but I should like to see the fruits. The
people always find excuses in you.... They say that
I have allowed their proceedings.... I do not understand
that <i>dance</i>, and I affirm that I said nothing
with that intention, from which may God keep them.</p>

<div class="foot">
<div class="right1">'<span class="smc">The Bishop of Geneva.</span>'<span
     class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_491" id="Ref_491" href="#Foot_491">[491]</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>It was reported at Geneva that the bishop was
willing to make some concessions, that he had said so
privately, and the huguenots took advantage of it to
assert their independence. On the 28th November
Pierre de la Baume wrote to Besançon Hugues from the
Tour de Mai: 'Besançon, I have seen what you wrote
touching the mode of proceeding against my authority
and to the detriment of my church. I know whence
that comes ... except that I have always been
given to understand that, according to the common
opinion, my subjects would have been much better
guided and would have obeyed me better than they
have done, if you had been willing to set your hand
to it, as you had promised me, endeavouring to procure
the peace of the city, which suffers the greatest
loss on my part. As to what you write about being
under my displeasure, the only regret I feel as regards
you is that you have not been willing to do what you
promised. The recompense I made you was to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">{325}</a></span>
end that you might keep my possessions in peace,
but they are more than ever in war. It is entirely
your fault if my jurisdiction is not still kept up.
I write to you in order that you may perform your
duty.... You will do me a pleasure: I would not
have so many words to be without result....
As for me I am accustomed to do <i>something vigorously</i>....
<i>I shall consider what it must be.</i>'</p>

<p>Such are the threatening words which close the
correspondence of Pierre de la Baume with Besançon
Hugues. Until now all traces of this great citizen
had been lost after the 26th September 1532. If the
letter we have just given belongs to this year, that
limit would be shortened by two months. He must
have died between the 28th November 1532 and the
18th February 1533.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_492" id="Ref_492" href="#Foot_492">[492]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the bishop, continually engrossed with Geneva,
thought of nothing but recovering his former power.
But the independence of that city had enemies more
formidable still. Charles V. had ordered the Genevans
to drive the Reformation from their walls. 'Full of
anxiety for your soul's health,' he wrote to them,
'and learning that certain new opinions and sects are
beginning to swarm among you,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_493" id="Ref_493" href="#Foot_493">[493]</a></span>
we exhort you
seriously not to admit them, to extirpate them, and
to set about it with the utmost diligence, not to permit
anything to be taught among you in the leastwise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">{326}</a></span>
opposed to the decrees and traditions of your ancestors;
on the contrary, to preserve with unshaken
constancy the faith, rites, and ceremonies that you
have received from your fathers. You will thus
receive a worthy reward from Almighty God, and will
merit from us every sort of gratitude.' Geneva had
not obeyed the orders of the puissant emperor. The
affairs of Germany had at first prevented him from
constraining the little city to follow his sovereign
orders, which even the barbarous tribes of the new
world obeyed. But now the treaty of Nuremberg
was signed; Charles having come to terms with the
protestants of Germany might easily keep the promise
he had made to his brother-in-law through Bellegarde,
and assist him against the huguenots of Geneva.</p>

<p class="side">=FREEDOM IN SIGHT.=</p>

<p>The perfidious murderer of Levrier was beginning
to hope that it would be possible to found a stronghold
in Geneva, with its ditches and lofty walls,
flanked with towers and bastions, and a strong garrison
of halberdiers, arquebusiers, and artillerymen, who
would keep the city and country in complete subjection
under the yoke of their master. When Gessler
was sent in the name of Austria to destroy the
liberties of the Swiss, did he not build a fortress above
Altorf—<i>Zwing-Uri</i>, the yoke of Uri? and had not the
free children of those mountains to atone for the
smallest sparks of independence by long and costly
imprisonment in gloomy dungeons? Had not Pharaoh
set the example in Egypt?... Why should not they
do the same to subdue the huguenots? Fortresses,
cannons, arquebusses, chains ... this was what
Geneva had to expect. Before any great length of
time the Genevans were really to see a formidable force
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">{327}</a></span>
marching against them, commissioned to carry out the
plans of the emperor and the duke. But God's providence
had always kept the city, and at this very
moment a new force, the pledge of liberty, was about
to be given it. The Gospel of the Son of God was
about to enter its walls. But <i>he whom the Son maketh
free, shall be free indeed</i>.</p>

 <span style="font-size:80%">THE REFORMERS AND THE REFORMATION ENTER GENEVA.<br />
 (<span class="smc">October 1532.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON one fine autumn day (2nd October), Farel and
Saunier 'having finished their journey through
Piedmont,' reached that beautiful neighbourhood
where the Alps and the Jura, drawing near each
other, form a rich valley, in the midst of which calmly
sleep the pure waters of an azure lake. They soon
distinguished the three old towers of the cathedral of
Geneva rising high above the houses. They pressed
their horses, whose speed was relaxed through fatigue,
and entered the city of the huguenots. They had
been directed to the Tour Percée,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_494" id="Ref_494" href="#Foot_494">[494]</a></span>
which they found
in a street situated on the left bank of the Rhone, and
bearing its name. They stopped in front of the inn,
dismounted from their horses, spoke to the landlord,
and took up their quarters under his roof.</p>

<p class="side">=FAREL CONSULTS WITH OLIVETAN.=</p>

<p>One of their first thoughts, after resting themselves,
was to inform Robert Olivetan of their arrival.
Calvin's cousin, who was still tutor to Jean Chautemps'
children, hastened to them, delighted at the
coming of his brethren. Farel desired to consult
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">{329}</a></span>
with him on the best means of advancing the knowledge
of the Gospel in Geneva; but another idea had
also occupied him during his journey. Knowing how
learned Olivetan was in Greek and Hebrew, he had cast
his eyes on him to make the translation of the Bible
which the Waldensian synod had decided upon. Farel
having spoken to him about it, Olivetan exclaimed in
alarm: 'I cannot accept such a commission, considering
the great difficulty of the work and my own weakness.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_495" id="Ref_495" href="#Foot_495">[495]</a></span>
Farel did not admit the excuse, and continued
to solicit his friend, who would not give way.
'You could do this work much better yourself,' he
said to the travellers. But Farel believed that God
gives every man a calling for which He has prepared
him, and that Olivetan was a scholar while he was an
evangelist. 'God has not given me leisure,' said
Farel, 'He calls me to another work. He wills me
to sow the pure seed of the Word in His field, and
water it and make it flourish like the garden of Eden.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_496" id="Ref_496" href="#Foot_496">[496]</a></span>
He dropped the subject, however, in order to talk with
Olivetan about the evangelisation of Geneva.</p>

<p>Chautemps' tutor, who had so often sunk under
the weight of his task, and so earnestly called for a
stronger hand, looked upon Farel as one sent from
heaven. But how to begin? The evangelist of Orbe
took from his pocket the letters given him at Berne
for some of the chief huguenots. Olivetan saw that a
door was opening for the Gospel, and without loss of
time the two friends went out to deliver the letters to
their addresses. Olivetan gave Farel the information
he required, and explained to him that although some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">{330}</a></span>
of those to whom he was introduced inclined to the
side of the Gospel, the majority were content to throw
off the Romish superstitions, and were simply true
patriots.</p>

<p>The huguenots having opened the letters that Farel
presented, found that the bearer was William Farel,
preacher of the Gospel, and that their Bernese friends
invited them to hear him speak. This was great
news. No name was better known than Farel's in
the districts bathed by the lakes of Geneva, Morat,
Bienne, and Neuchatel. The huguenots, delighted
to see him, looked attentively at him, and some of
them reflected on such an unexpected incident, which
religious and political motives rendered most important
in their eyes. Friends of the Reformation had
often told them that the independence of Geneva would
never be secure until the dominion of the bishop
and the pope had given place to that of the Gospel,
and now the Gospel was knocking at their doors in
the person of Farel. Was it not he who had filled
Aigle, Morat, Neuchatel, Valengin, Orbe, and Grandson
with the evangelical doctrine? Political men
hoped that at his voice the temporal dominion of the
church would fall, and the phantoms of the middle
ages, which still entangled liberty, would flee away in
alarm to distant hiding-places. Religious men, who
had found pleasure in the words of Am Thun, of
Olivetan, and of the Gospel more especially, expected
that this great preacher would make the light of
heaven to shine in their hearts. All, therefore, expressed
themselves ready to hear him,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_497" id="Ref_497" href="#Foot_497">[497]</a></span>
and Farel,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">{331}</a></span>
saying he should be happy to see them at his inn,
took his leave.</p>

<p class="side">=HUGUENOTS GO TO HEAR FAREL.=</p>

<p>The news of the reformer's arrival spread through
the city in a moment.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_498" id="Ref_498" href="#Foot_498">[498]</a></span>
'Let us go and hear him,'
said the huguenots; 'it is the man they call <i>the
scourge of the little priests</i>.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_499" id="Ref_499" href="#Foot_499">[499]</a></span>
But the nuns, bigots, and
friars were filled with anger. 'A shabby little
preacher,' said the sisters of St. Claire; 'one Master
William, a native of Gap in Dauphiny, has just arrived in the city.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_500" id="Ref_500" href="#Foot_500">[500]</a></span>
Every one prepared for the morrow.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 3d of October, the most
notable of the huguenots left their houses to go to
the Tour Perce. They went singly, or at the most
two or three together, with a certain fear. One after
another the following persons might have been seen
entering the inn: the amiable and active Ami Porral,
one of the syndics of the year; Baudichon de la Maison
Neuve, who had stuck up the 'Great Pardon of God;'
syndic Robert Vandel and his brother Pierre—all
these intimate acquaintances of the bishop; Claude
Roset, secretary of state in the following year, and
father of the chronicler; syndic Claude Savoy, one of
the most zealous defenders of independence; Jean
Chautemps, Olivetan's patron; Dominic Arlod, afterwards
syndic; Stephen Dada, descended from an
illustrious Milanese family, and properly called
d'Adda, from the city of that name; Claude Salomon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">{332}</a></span>
the friend of the poor and the sick; Claude Bernard;
Jean Goulaz, who had torn down the bill of the
Romish jubilee from the pillar of the cathedral; Jean
Sourd, Claude de Genève, and lastly, the energetic
Ami Perrin, who several times syndic, captain-general,
and ambassador of the Republic at Paris, showed
much zeal for the Reformation at first, but afterwards
incurred severe reproach.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_501" id="Ref_501" href="#Foot_501">[501]</a></span>
These citizens, who were
the <i>élite</i> of Geneva, with several other persons of
less distinction, arrived at the reformers' lodgings.
The landlord of the Tour Perce introduced them into
a private room where they found Farel and Saunier.
The conversation began.</p>

<p class="side">=HE SHOWS THEM THEIR DEFICIENCIES.=</p>

<p>The two evangelists were full of esteem for the
men who were struggling with such courage for independence
and liberty against powerful enemies.
They were not slow, however, to observe that if, in a
political light, they held the most elevated sentiments,
there were great deficiencies in them in a religious
light. The huguenots wanted neither pope nor priests;
but it was because of the tyranny of the one, and the
licentious conduct of the others;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_502" id="Ref_502" href="#Foot_502">[502]</a></span>
as for the true
doctrine of the Gospel and the necessity of a moral
transformation in themselves, they had not troubled
themselves about it. There was also a great void in
their religious system. Before they could become
good protestants and men morally strong, friends at
once of order and liberty, this blank must be filled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">{333}</a></span>
up. They felt it themselves, and told Farel they
desired nothing better than to be instructed. The
landlord brought in a few benches and stools for
them, and then Farel, having Saunier near him, took
his station before a little table. He placed a Bible
on it, and began to speak from the Word of God. An
audience so select, an opportunity so important for
announcing the Gospel, had perhaps never been
offered to the reformer. He had before him the
earliest champions of modern liberty. These men
had recognised the errors in the state, he must now
show them the errors in the church; they must learn
that if man may throw off despotism in earthly things,
it is more lawful still to throw it off in heavenly
things.</p>

<p>Farel undertook the task; he showed the huguenots
from Scripture 'that they had been abused until now
by their priests; that the latter amused them with
silly tales that had no substance in them, and further,
that these cheats (<i>affronteurs</i>) allured them, if they
felt it necessary, by flattery, and gave the rein to their
lusts.' He added that neither councils nor popes
would teach them to know Jesus Christ, but Holy
Scripture only; and urged them to abandon errors
and abuses, whose danger and absurdity he forcibly
pointed out to them. The huguenots listened to him
attentively. 'They had no great sentiment or knowledge
or fear of God, but they already aspired to the
religion that had been adopted at Berne,' says a manuscript
of the seventeenth century; 'and God, seeing
his people of Geneva stagnating in security, and wishing
by an effort of his mercy to show them the divine
sweetness of his clemency, animated the courage of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">{334}</a></span>
servants, Farel and Saunier.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_503" id="Ref_503" href="#Foot_503">[503]</a></span>
The simple movement
by which Farel, setting aside all patristic, synodal,
scholastic, and papal traditions, turned reverently
towards the fountain-head, and drank from the
Word of God the faith that he preached, specially
struck his hearers. They rose, thanked him, and left
the room, saying as they retired that it seemed right to
substitute the Holy Scriptures for the teaching of the
pope. This was the principle of an immense transformation.
The Reformation had taken its first step
in Geneva when the placards of the 'general pardon'
of God had been stuck up: it now took the second
step.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_504" id="Ref_504" href="#Foot_504">[504]</a></span></p>

<p>'There was a great sensation in the city,' said Froment.
Some of the hearers, returning to their families
or their friends, astonished them by saying that henceforth
their master should be neither M. La Baume, nor
M. Medicis or even M. St. Peter, 'but the Lord Jesus
Christ alone.' The astonishment was still greater in the
political and ecclesiastical bodies. Hitherto they had
only had to deal with the heroes of liberal emancipation;
now they were in presence of the champions of
the religious movement. 'This thing having come
to the notice of the council, canons, and priests of the
city, they were suddenly troubled and disturbed.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_505" id="Ref_505" href="#Foot_505">[505]</a></span>
The monks were either astounded or very angry,
while the nuns of St. Claire were quite alarmed at
'this wretched preacher, who was beginning to speak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">{335}</a></span>
secretly at his quarters, in a room, seeking to infect
the people with his heresy.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_506" id="Ref_506" href="#Foot_506">[506]</a></span>
All of them foresaw
that this act would have innumerable and fatal consequences.</p>

<p class="side">=FAREL'S SECOND LECTURE.=</p>

<p>There was soon a second meeting. Many of those
who had not been at the first wished to be present at
this; and from the city, the Molard, and the Rhone
bridge, many citizens took their way towards the Tour
Perce. There were no women among them, but the
men filled every corner of the room, anxious to hear
the Gospel. As Farel on the former occasion had
spoken particularly of scripture, he now addressed the
huguenots on the subject of living grace. He showed
them that it was not the pardon of the Church, but
the pardon of God, that saves. Those prelates and
masters who, puffed out with magnificent titles, were
continually recommending pious works, were (he said)
building the temple of God with straw and stubble,
instead of bringing together the living stones of which
scripture speaks. He maintained that when the priests
spoke so much of penance, vows, masses, fasts, aves,
macerations, flagellations, indulgences, pilgrimages,
invocations to the Virgin and the saints, they hardly
left Jesus Christ the hundredth part of the work of
redemption. Farel and Saunier repeated strongly that
pardon resides wholly in the Saviour, and not in part
only, 'at which those who heard him took great pleasure.'
Some meditated as they went away on what
they had heard, and that silent conversation of the soul
speaking with its God began in the quiet chamber of
many a house. 'By this means a goodly number of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">{336}</a></span>
Genevans received a knowledge of the Gospel.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_507" id="Ref_507" href="#Foot_507">[507]</a></span>
Somenof them—Baudichon de la Maison-Neuve and Claude
Salomon amongst others—earnestly besought Farel
to come and explain the Scriptures in their own
houses.</p>

<p>This second meeting added considerably to the
alarm in the catholic camp, and the commotion was
particularly great among the women, who were at that
time the main support of the papacy in Geneva.
'There is not one of them,' said a reformer, 'that
has any desire to learn the truth, so tainted are they
with the breath, teaching, life, and conversation of
their priests. There is a great intimacy between
them; some are their brothers, others their friends,
neighbours, gossips.... I shall say nothing more at
present,' he added, 'to save the honour of the ladies.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_508" id="Ref_508" href="#Foot_508">[508]</a></span>
The priests told their female parishioners that if they
did not turn out these unbelievers everything was lost.
The Genevan ladies, therefore, entreated their husbands
and brothers to expel the heretic preachers. A few
citizens, who cared very little about the Reformation,
were carried away by their wives, and proceeding
angry and heated to the Tour Perce, desired Farel
and Saunier to leave Geneva at once, if they did not
wish to be turned out forcibly. 'If we cannot maintain
what we say,' replied the reformers, 'we offer
ourselves to death.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_509" id="Ref_509" href="#Foot_509">[509]</a></span>
Having God for the author of
their faith, they were tranquil in the midst of tempests.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_510" id="Ref_510" href="#Foot_510">[510]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, despite all the efforts of the husbands urged
by their wives, and of the wives urged by the priests,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">{337}</a></span>
Farel remained. At that time a great agitation prevailed
in Geneva: canons, rectors, monks, and curates
ran up and down, talking with one another, 'and
holding counsel together, asked what they should do
with those persons.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_511" id="Ref_511" href="#Foot_511">[511]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=FAREL BEFORE THE TOWN-COUNCIL.=</p>

<p>The magistrates, noticing the commotion occasioned
by the arrival of Farel and Saunier in the city, summoned
them to appear before the bench, and met to
consult as to what should be said and done to them.
The council had not made up their minds either for or
against the Reformation, and many of the members
arrived at the town-hall not knowing clearly what they
ought to do. Ex-syndic Balard, who was then discharging
the functions of vidame, a zealous Catholic
whom Froment calls (probably with some exaggeration)
'the head servant of the priests,' was for immediate
repression, and a few were ready to vote with
him. The majority, composed of men of moderate
views, had no desire to offend the canons and priests,
but feared still more to offend Berne. William Hugues,
the premier syndic and Besançon's brother, was rather
favourable to the reformers. Only a small number of
decided huguenots were convinced that the new doctrine
alone could free them from the bickerings of the
bishops and the dukes. Farel and Saunier were conducted
to the town-hall and taken into the council chamber.
As they entered, everybody looked with curious
eye on that man with keen look and red beard who
was setting all the country in a blaze from the Alps to
the Jura. One of the magistrates most devoted to the
Church addressing Farel rudely, said: 'It is you then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">{338}</a></span>
that do nothing but disturb the world; it is your
tongue that is stirring up tumult everywhere and
trumpeting rebellion. You are a busybody who have
come here only to create discord. We order you to
depart from the city instantly.' The angry looks
of some of the councillors were at the same time
turned upon Farel, who being regarded as the scourge
of the priests, 'was for that reason supremely hated by them.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_512" id="Ref_512" href="#Foot_512">[512]</a></span>
The reformer contained himself, and
answered: 'I am not a deluder, I am not a trumpet of
sedition; I simply proclaim the truth.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_513" id="Ref_513" href="#Foot_513">[513]</a></span>
I am ready to prove out of God's Word that my doctrine is true,
and,' added he in a voice trembling with emotion,
'not only to sacrifice my ease but to shed the last drop
of my blood for it.'</p>

<p>The reformer's noble simplicity touched the members
of the council, and supplied the huguenots with
sufficient motives to undertake his defence. Farel's
judges appeared to be softened by his moderation.
Then calling to mind that St. Paul under similar
circumstances had invoked the respected name of imperial
Rome, the evangelist resolved to follow his
example. 'Most honoured lords,' he said, 'are you not
allies and co-burgesses of Berne? Know, then, that
my lords of Berne, who have at heart to advance the
Gospel, have given me letters wherein they bear witness
to my innocence and doctrine, and beg you to hear
me preach peacefully, assuring you that by so doing
you will confer a pleasure on them.' At the same time
Farel produced the credentials with which their excellencies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">{339}</a></span>
had furnished him. The syndics took the
letter. 'If you condemn me unheard,' continued Farel,
'you insult God, and also, as you see, my lords of
Berne.' The latter plea touched the magistrates of
Geneva closely; and, accordingly, changing countenance,
they gently dismissed Farel and Saunier without
imposing any punishment on them, but begging
them only not to disturb the public tranquillity by new
doctrines. The two ministers quitted the council
chamber.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_514" id="Ref_514" href="#Foot_514">[514]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=DELIBERATIONS OF THE CLERGY.=</p>

<p>Meanwhile an episcopal council was being held;
and jurists, canons, and priests were assembling at
the house of the grand vicar. Monseigneur de Gingins,
abbot of Bonmont, deliberated as to what should be
done. The Reformation and the reformers, of whom
there had been so much talk these fifteen years, were
in Geneva at last. The rock so long suspended over
their heads was at length detached from the mountain,
and threatened to destroy everything. What was to
be done? The tumult was still greater in the city
than in the grand vicar's house. A crowd, attracted
by the summons of Farel and Saunier before the
council, 'was scattered up and down the streets,' and
priests paraded the city, 'carrying arms under their frocks.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_515" id="Ref_515" href="#Foot_515">[515]</a></span>
The reformers had some trouble to reach
their lodgings.</p>

<p>The episcopal council prolonged its sittings. Monseigneur
de Bonmont, a sincere but moderate and liberal
catholic, was ill at ease. Seeing angry faces and
flashing eyes around him, he represented that it would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">{340}</a></span>
be necessary to proceed cautiously and in accordance
with justice. Some of those present were exasperated,
for in their eyes De Gingins' moderation was flagrant
treason. In their opinion it was necessary to prosecute
immediately not only the foreign preachers, but 'all
who inviting them into their houses (as Maison-Neuve
for instance) to converse about the Gospel, wished to
live differently from what their forefathers, pastors, and
bishops had taught them.' The most reverend vicar
represented that persons were not convicted without
being heard, that they must summon these strangers
before them, call upon them to explain their doctrine,
and then they would be sentenced upon full knowledge
of the facts. This alarmed the council, and Dom Stephen
Piard, proctor to the chapter, exclaimed with a frown:<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_516" id="Ref_516" href="#Foot_516">[516]</a></span>
'If we dispute, all our office is at an end.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_517" id="Ref_517" href="#Foot_517">[517]</a></span>
He urged that 'to discuss theological questions was to overlook
the authority of the church; that we must believe
because Rome has spoken; that these people with their
Bibles were subtle spirits and dangerous adversaries,
... and that the authority of the chapter would be
overthrown if they permitted any disputation.'</p>

<p class="side">=CONSPIRACY AGAINST FAREL.=</p>

<p>Dom Stephen enjoyed a certain authority; the assembly
was about to refuse to hear Farel, when it was
opposed by some of the members who were most
notorious for their fanatical zeal. In the sixteenth
century not only jurists regarded it as a duty to condemn
heretics to death, but devout persons, laymen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">{341}</a></span>
as well as priests, thought they did an acceptable thing
to God by putting them to death. It would appear
that these latter persons had made up their minds to
this meritorious work. 'Having deliberated to kill
Farel and his companion,' says a manuscript, 'they
found the best means of getting them to come would
be by giving them to understand that they desired to
debate with them.' The pious sister Jeanne de Jussie
corroborates this statement.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_518" id="Ref_518" href="#Foot_518">[518]</a></span>
The conspirators carried
the proposal to summon Farel. He was never to go
out again from the vicar-general's house; but first of
all it was necessary for him to enter it. Machard, the
bishop's secretary, was deputed to summon Farel and
Saunier, and also Olivetan, 'to retract publicly, or to
explain before the episcopal council what they had
preached in the inn.'</p>

<p>Ere long something transpired of the plot of these
fanatical ecclesiastics, and the huguenots, forming
part of the little council at that moment assembled in
the town-hall, represented to their colleagues that the
priests had no other object than to draw the ministers
into a trap. Accordingly the two chief magistrates,
Hugues and Balard, accompanied Machard to the Tour
Perce, to give a guarantee to Farel and his friends.
Some persons suspected Balard of wishing to get Farel
and Saunier into trouble. 'There is nothing more
prejudicial to Geneva than division,' he said; 'I wish
those who disturb us were well out of us.' But he was
neither a coward nor a traitor; he was determined to
send the reformers away from Geneva, but to protect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">{342}</a></span>
their lives.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_519" id="Ref_519" href="#Foot_519">[519]</a></span>
On reaching the inn the bishop's secretary
informed the evangelists that the episcopal council
invited them to retract the doctrines they had taught,
the presence of Balard and Hugues giving weight to
the request. Farel answered: 'We affirm these doctrines
in the strongest way possible, and again offer to
die if we cannot prove them out of scripture.' 'In
that case,' resumed Machard, 'come before the episcopal
council to discuss with the priests, and maintain what
you have said.' 'No harm shall be done you,' said
the premier syndic and the vidame, 'we pledge our
word to it.' Farel and Saunier, delighted with this
opportunity of announcing the Gospel, set off, accompanied
by Olivetan. They were calm and full of joy,
doubtless not expecting what awaited them, but ready
nevertheless to give up their lives.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">THE REFORMERS ARE EXPELLED FROM GENEVA.<br />
 (<span class="smc">October 1532.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="side">=FAREL BEFORE THE EPISCOPAL COUNCIL.=</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WHILE the upper house of the clergy was sitting
at the vicar-general's, the lower house had assembled
in the streets. The armed curates and
chaplains watched what was going on, and when they
saw the premier syndic with ex-syndic Balard and
the bishop's secretary enter the inn, they guessed
that they were about to conduct Farel before the
episcopal council, and had immediately made it known
to their followers, to the women and the common
people. When the three reformers, accompanied by
the three Genevans, came out, there was already a
little crowd in front of the Tour Perce. The number
increased as they proceeded along the streets which
lead from the banks of the Rhone to the top of the
hill; but the populace and the women were content
to threaten and jeer at the reformers, crying out as
loud as they could, 'Look at the dogs, look at the dogs.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_520" id="Ref_520" href="#Foot_520">[520]</a></span>
Thanks to the presence of the magistrates,
the three reformers arrived safe and sound in the
Rue des Chanoines and entered the house of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">{344}</a></span>
vicar episcopal. As those who were within as well as
those who were without had equally sworn Farel's
death, it seemed impossible for him to escape. The
three evangelicals had to wait some time; in fact
the syndics had preceded them, and required of the
episcopal council that no harm should be done the
ministers if they freely explained their doctrines.
This engagement having been taken, Farel, Saunier,
and Olivetan were called in, the two magistrates remaining
in the assembly to secure order.</p>

<p class="side">=VEIGY'S INVECTIVES.=</p>

<p>The abbot-vicar of Bonmont presided; on his right
and left sat the canons, the bishop's officers, and the
head priests, all in their sacerdotal robes. The missionary,
simply but decently dressed, came forward
followed by his two friends, and all three remained
standing before the assembly. The official, Messire
de Veigy, a learned and eloquent man, was ordered
to speak. 'William Farel,' he said, 'tell me who has
sent you, for what reason you come here, and in
virtue of what authority you speak?' In Veigy's
opinion it was necessary for the preacher to be sent
by some Romish ecclesiastical authority. Farel replied
with simplicity, 'I am sent by God, and I am
come to announce his word.' 'Poor wretch!' exclaimed
the priests, as they shrugged their shoulders.
The official resumed: 'God has sent you, you say; how
is that? Can you show by any manifest sign that you
are come in His name? As Moses before Pharaoh,
will you prove to us by miracles that you really come
from God? If you cannot, then show us the licence
of our most reverend prelate the Bishop of Geneva.
Preacher never yet preached in his diocese without
his leave.'</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">{345}</a></div>

<p>Here the official paused; and then disdainfully
scanning the reformer from head to foot, he said:
'You do not wear the dress that is usual for those
who are accustomed to announce the Word of God to
us.... You are dressed like a soldier or a brigand....
How is it you are so bold as to preach? Is it
not forbidden by a decree of holy church for laymen
to preach in public under pain of excommunication?
That is contained in the decretals of our holy mother
church.... You are, therefore, a deceiver and a bad man.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_521" id="Ref_521" href="#Foot_521">[521]</a></span>
Farel believed that it was his duty to
announce the Word of God, because Jesus Christ had
said, <i>Preach the Gospel to every creature</i>. He thought
that the true successors of the apostles were those
who conformed to Christ's order, and that (as Calvin
says), 'the pope of Rome and all his tribe had no
claim to that apostolical succession which they alleged,
since they no longer cared for the doctrine of Christ.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_522" id="Ref_522" href="#Foot_522">[522]</a></span>
The clergy in whose presence he was standing did
not allow him time to speak. At last they had before
them the terrible heretic of whom they had been
talking so many years. The official's words had still
further aroused their passions; they could no longer
contain themselves. Pale with anger they shuddered
and clattered with their feet as they sat. At last the
mine exploded; they all spoke at once, pouring insult
and abuse on the reformer. Their excitement carried
them away; they rose from their seats, rushed upon
him, and pulling him now this way, now that, exclaimed,
'Come, Farel, you wicked devil, what business
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">{346}</a></span>
have you to go up and down, disturbing all the world?...
Are you baptized? Where were you born?
Where do you come from? Why did you come here?
Tell us by whose authority you preach? Are you not
the man who propagated Luther's heresies at Aigle
and Neuchatel, and threw the whole country into
confusion? Who sent you into this city?' The noise
and tumult would not permit either Farel or the
grand vicar to speak; the weapons were heard to
rattle which some of the priests carried under their
frocks. Farel remained still and silent in the midst
of this raging sea. At last Messire de Bonmont succeeded
in interposing his authority, made his colleagues
resume their seats, and silence was restored.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_523" id="Ref_523" href="#Foot_523">[523]</a></span>
Then the reformer, nobly lifting up his head, said with
great simplicity, 'My lords, I am not a devil. I was
baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, and if I journey to and fro, it is that I may
preach Jesus Christ—Jesus Christ crucified, dead
for our sins, and risen again for our justification, so
that whosoever believeth in Him shall have everlasting
life. As an ambassador of Jesus Christ I am
compelled to teach Him to all who are willing to hear
me. I have, however, no other right to speak than
that which the commandment of God gives to me
His servant. My only aim is so to discharge my
duty that all the world may receive salvation, and it
is for this cause and for no other that I am come into
this city. Having been brought before you to give
an account of my faith, I am ready to do so, not only
at this moment, but as many times as you please to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">{347}</a></span>
hear me peaceably. What I have preached and still
preach is the pure truth and not a heresy, and I will
maintain it even unto death. As for what you say
about my disturbing the land and this city in particular,
I will answer as Elijah did to Ahab, <i>I have
not troubled Israel, but thou and thy father's house</i>.
Yes, it is you and yours who trouble the world by
your traditions, your human inventions, and your
dissolute lives.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_524" id="Ref_524" href="#Foot_524">[524]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THREATS AGAINST FAREL.=</p>

<p>The priests, astonished at the calm, simple, free and
spirited language of the reformer, had listened to
him in silence so far, but the moment they heard him
speak of their human inventions and irregular lives,
his words were like daggers and disturbed their
wicked consciences. It might have been said that the
infernal deities (it is the expression of a reformer)
were hovering about them and left them no repose.
'They fixed their burning eyes on Farel; they gnashed
their teeth,' says a manuscript; and one of them
starting up in a passion said: 'Blasphematur, non
amplius indigemus testibus. Reus est mortis.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_525" id="Ref_525" href="#Foot_525">[525]</a></span>
This was the signal for a scene more savage than the
former. All rose again, some impelled by violence
and pride, others believing they were supporting the
cause of religion, and exclaimed: 'To the Rhone, to
the Rhone! kill him, kill him! It is better for this
rascally Lutheran to die than permit him to trouble
all the people.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_526" id="Ref_526" href="#Foot_526">[526]</a></span>
These words, without being those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">{348}</a></span>
which the high-priest uttered against Christ were very
like them. Farel was struck by the resemblance.
'Speak the words of God and not of Caiaphas,' he exclaimed.
At these words the exasperated priests
could contain themselves no longer. They all started
up together and shouted out: 'Kill him, kill the
Lutheran hound!' Dom Bergeri, proctor to the chapter,
still more excited than the others, urged them
on, exclaiming in his Savoyard dialect: <i>Tapa, tapa!</i>
(which, adds Froment, means 'Strike, strike!') The
sentence was immediately carried into execution;
they surrounded the three reformers; some caught
hold of Farel, others of Saunier, and others of
Olivetan. They abused them, beat them, spat in
their faces, and uttered all sorts of cries, so that it
was like a pandemonium. In the midst of all this
uproar Farel and his companions 'preserved their
patience and moderation.' The abbot of Bonmont,
syndics Hugues and Balard, and even a few priests,
ashamed of such a scene, tried to put an end to it.
'It is not well done,' said the abbot, 'have we not
pledged our word and honour to them?' Syndic
Hugues, a just, quick, and energetic man, disgusted
with the behaviour of the ecclesiastics, broke out at
last. 'You are wicked men,' he said; 'we brought
you these men on your promise that no harm should
be done them, and you want to beat and kill them
before our faces.... I will go and set the great bell
ringing to convoke the general council. The assembled
people shall decide.' Hugues was leaving
the room to go and put his threat into execution,
when Balard, the other magistrate, desiring to prevent
anything that might compromise the cause of Rome,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">{349}</a></span>
endeavoured to calm him. However the syndic's
threat had produced its effect; the priests alarmed at
the thought of a general assembly of the citizens, and
fearing lest it should decree their expulsion from
Geneva, returned to their seats rather ashamed of
themselves. The abbot, taking advantage of this new
lull, desired Farel and his friends to withdraw, in
order that the episcopal council might deliberate.
Farel left the room covered with spittle and severely bruised.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_527" id="Ref_527" href="#Foot_527">[527]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=FAREL ASSAULTED.=</p>

<p>While the superior clergy were behaving in this
way, the inferior clergy were assembling, and about
eighty priests had collected before the house of the
vicar-episcopal, 'all well armed with clubs to defend
the holy catholic faith and prepared to die for it.' This
mode of defending religion, so different from that of
the first fathers of the church, has been made known
to us through the reverend Sister Jeanne de Jussie.
The priests were stout, resolute men; they had
formed a plot and were there to carry it into execution.
'They wished,' adds Sister Jeanne, 'to put
that wretch and his accomplices to a bitter death.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_528" id="Ref_528" href="#Foot_528">[528]</a></span>
Such was the exploit they contemplated, and for
its accomplishment they carefully surrounded the
grand-vicar's house. They filled the narrow area
of the Puits St. Pierre and the Rue des Chanoines,
and had even penetrated into M. de Bonmont's
courtyard and garden, so that it was impossible for
Farel to escape. The fanatical and agitated crowd,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">{350}</a></span>
which had been there for some time, was beginning to
grow impatient that the episcopal council sat so long.
Farel and his two friends, when they had turned into
a long gallery, could hear the raised voices of some of
the members of the council, and the increasing noise
of the crowd that filled the courtyard. But another
danger threatened them.</p>

<p>One of the grand-vicar's servants, Francis Olard,
surnamed Ginin, a violent man, stood at the end of
the gallery, having been posted there arquebus in
hand, as a sentinel. He had listened to the tumult
from within; the shouting from without excited and
inflamed him. Was not this Farel the enemy of his
masters—a heretic whom everybody wished dead?
His weapon was ready: he levelled it at Farel and
prepared to fire. Had the priests stationed Olard
there for this purpose, as the chronicles say, or did he
act of his own accord, being more fanatical than his
masters, as the servants of political or ecclesiastical
corporations often are? Be it as it may, the arquebusier
pulled the trigger, the priming flashed ... but
the gun did not go off. Farel turning to him said
coldly: 'I am not to be shaken by a popgun; your
toy does not alarm me.'—'Verily,' said his friends,
'God of His mercy turned aside the blow, in order to
preserve Farel for struggles still more formidable.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_529" id="Ref_529" href="#Foot_529">[529]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=DANGER OF FAREL AND HIS FRIENDS.=</p>

<p>Meanwhile the council were still deliberating, and
many wished Farel to be put to death. Heresy in
that age, as is but too well known, was punished
capitally; but the magistrates pointed to the danger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">{351}</a></span>
of using violence towards the preacher of the lords of
Berne. Their opinion prevailed, and the reformers
having been brought into the room again, the grand-vicar
said: 'William Farel, leave my presence and
this house, and within six hours get you gone from
the city with your two companions, under pain of the
stake. And know that if the sentence is not more severe,
you must ascribe it to our kindness and to our respect
for my lords of Berne.'—'You condemn us unheard,'
said Farel. 'I demand a certificate to show at Berne
that I have done my duty.'—'You shall not have one,'
the abbot hastily replied; 'leave the room all of you,
without a word more.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_530" id="Ref_530" href="#Foot_530">[530]</a></span></p>

<p>The priests and people collected in front of the
house, learning that Farel was about to appear, crowded
one upon another, uttering angry cries. It would
seem that the reformer heard them and stopped an
instant, knowing full well what was in reserve for
him. It was in truth a solemn moment, perhaps his
last. 'The caitiff dared not come out,' said Sister
Jeanne, afterwards Abbess of Annecy, 'for he had
heard the noise made by the church people before the
door, and feared they would put him to death.' Seeing
that Farel hesitated, two of the senior canons addressed
him coarsely: 'As you will not go out willingly, and
in God's name,' they said, 'go out in the name of all
the devils, whose minister and servant you are.' Thus
spoke a few fanatical priests. Their God was the
church, and there was no salvation for the sinner
except in the sacrifice of the mass: in them imagination
took the place of understanding, and passion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">{352}</a></span>
judgment. They had no idea of the living faith which
animated the hearts of Farel and his friends, and
looked upon them as impious. Putting aside the
holy authority and wise precepts of scripture, they
had no other rule than strong attachment to their
church and the excess of zeal which carried them
away. Inflamed by violent passion they did not
confine themselves to abuse. The sister of St. Claire
is far from wishing to conceal their exploits: 'One
of them,' she says, 'gave him a hard kick, the other
struck him heavily on the head and face; and in great
confusion they put him out with his two companions.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_531" id="Ref_531" href="#Foot_531">[531]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=ATTEMPT TO STAB FAREL.=</p>

<p>Farel, Saunier, and Olivetan quitted the house,
and thus escaped the ill-treatment of those reverend
gentlemen. But turned out of doors by the canons,
they fell from Scylla into Charybdis: they had to
experience still more culpable excesses of religious
fanaticism. The priests, chaplains, sacristans, and the
furious populace assembled in the street, hooted, hissed,
groaned, and howled; some threateningly flourished
their weapons. It was like an impetuous hurricane
that seemed as if it would sweep everything before it.
It was a human tempest more terrible perhaps than
that of the winds:</p>

     class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_532" id="Ref_532" href="#Foot_532">[532]</a></span></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On a sudden there was a movement in the crowd,
those who were on the outside falling back in alarm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">{353}</a></span>
upon their comrades: there was a body of armed men
approaching. At this time up came the syndics and
all the watch with their halberds. 'Pray, sir priests,'
said they, 'do nothing rash.' The mob gave way.
'We are come to execute justice,' added the magistrates.
Upon this they took 'the caitiff,' placed him
and his companions in the midst of the guard, and all
marched off in the direction of the Tour Perce, the
crowd parting right and left to make way for the
escort. The priests, fourscore in number, kept together,
forming a dark and agitated group, and so
stationed themselves that the three ministers must
necessarily pass before them on their road to the inn.
They had heard that Farel and his friends were to
be expelled from the city; 'but the worthy men
could not be satisfied with this,' says Sister Jeanne.
Considering that the syndics and even the episcopal
council refused to do justice to them, they were resolved
to take the matter into their own hands. Just
as the three preachers were passing in front of them,
one of them rushed forward sword in hand upon
Farel 'to run him through.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_533" id="Ref_533" href="#Foot_533">[533]</a></span>
One of the syndics
who was at the reformer's side saw him, caught the
assassin by the arm, and stopped him. This act of
the magistrate seriously grieved the devout. Laymen
who prevented the clergy from killing their adversaries
were looked upon as impious. 'Many were
chagrined,' says the good nun innocently, 'because
the blow failed.' The halberdiers closed their ranks,
thrust the priests and their creatures aside, and
the reformers continued on their way. The mob,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">{354}</a></span>
finding they could not touch the Lutherans, compensated
themselves with hooting. In every street
through which they passed, men and women cried
out that they ought to be flung into the Rhone.
At length the procession reached the Tour Perce;
the reformers entered, and the syndics left a guard.</p>

<p class="side">=FAREL'S DEPARTURE.=</p>

<p>They must go—of that there could be no doubt.
Farel and his friends might have been overwhelmed
with sorrow, and have fainted in the midst of their
work; but their Heavenly Master had said, <i>When they
persecute you in this city, flee ye into another</i>. (Matth.
x.&nbsp;23.) What grieved them was the thought of
the generous men who had listened to them; these
Farel was determined not to abandon. If the tempest
obliged him to depart, he would take advantage of the
first moment of calm weather to introduce into Geneva
that Gospel which many huguenots desired with all
their heart. The next day (4th October) a few citizens,
friends of the reformer, rose early, got ready a
boat near the Molard, and went to the Tour Perce to
fetch the missionaries, hoping that if the latter set off
betimes they would not be observed. But the priest-party
was quite as matutinal as they were: some of
them were already before the door, and it is probable
they had been there all night for fear the huguenots
should take advantage of the darkness to get the
ministers away. Claude Bernard, Ami Perrin, John
Goulaz, and Peter Verne—all stanch huguenots—came
up; they gave the signal, a door was opened, and
they entered the inn. A few moments elapsed during
which a number of priests and citizens assembled in
that part of the Rue du Rhone which lies between the
Tour Perce and the Molard. Presently the inn door
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">{355}</a></span>
opened again, and the four huguenots came out with
Farel and Saunier. When they saw them the crowd
became agitated. 'The devils are going,' shouted the
priests, as the two evangelists and their friends passed
along. Farel, seeing the numbers around him, wished
to exhort them, 'as he walked along;' but Perrin
would not permit it, representing to him that it
was necessary to push on quickly for fear the priests
should block the way. When the reformers reached
the water's edge, they got into the boat with their
defenders. The boatmen immediately began to row,
and the crowd that lined the shore could do nothing
but hoot. Perrin, fearing violence, would not land at
any of the towns or hamlets of Vaud, but steered the
boat to an unfrequented place between Morges and
Lausanne. Here they all got on shore and embraced
each other; after which the huguenots returned to
Geneva, and the reformers made their way to Orbe
and thence to Grandson.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER IX.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">A JOURNEY TO THE VALLEYS OF PIEDMONT,
 AND STRUGGLES NEAR NEUCHATEL.<br />
 (<span class="smc">End of 1532.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="side">=FAREL AND FROMENT.=</p>

<p class="drop-cap">FAREL expelled from Geneva, with a heart full of
love for those whom he had been obliged to quit,
meditated on the means of evangelising them, and
like a skilful general, was preparing even during his
retreat for a new and more successful struggle.
After having saluted the Christians of Orbe and
Grandson he departed for the village of Yvonand,
on the southern shore of the lake of Neuchatel,
where dwelt a youthful Christian Anthony Froment
by name, born at Val de Frières in Dauphiny in
1510, and consequently a year younger than Calvin
and his countryman Farel. The reformer invited
several evangelists to meet him in this village, and
about the middle of October there came Olivetan, who
had been unable to stay in Geneva after the departure
of his two friends; Adam, Martin (probably Martin
Gonin the Waldensian), and Guido (who must not be
confounded with the Belgian reformer Guido or Guy
von Brès) who with Farel, Saunier, Froment, and
others formed a little council. Farel gave an account
of his mission: he described his journey to the valleys
of Piedmont, and the stormy reception he had met
with at Geneva. They all looked with interest on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">{357}</a></span>
fugitive missionary who had escaped as by a miracle
from the violence of the Genevan priests. Froment in
particular could not take his eyes off the reformer;
every word of Farel's made a deep impression on him,
and disgusted with the ministers of popery, he pitied
the fate of the huguenots deprived of God's word by
the intrigues of the clergy. Farel, fixing his eyes
on him, said: 'Go and try if you can find an entrance
into Geneva to preach there.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_534" id="Ref_534" href="#Foot_534">[534]</a></span>
Froment was disturbed
and speechless. He possessed learning and talents;
but he was young and without experience, and wanted
that perseverance and firmness by which other reformers
were distinguished. His feelings were sensitive,
his imagination was ardent, but his character
was uneven and rather fickle. He is believed to have
been drawn to the Reformation more by witnessing
the excesses of Rome than by the inner charms of the
Word of God.</p>

<p>'Alas! father,' he said to Farel, 'how can I face the
enemies from whom you were compelled to flee?'—'Begin,'
replied Farel, 'as I began at Aigle, where I
was a schoolmaster at first and taught little children,
so that even the priests gave me liberty to preach.
True they soon repented; and even now I seem to
hear the curate exclaiming: "I would sooner have
lost my hand than introduced this man, for he will
ruin all our business." But it was too late; the Word
of God had begun its work, and the mass and images
fell.' Froment, who was at that time full of ardour
and zeal, began to familiarise himself gradually
with the idea of going to the city that drove out the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">{358}</a></span>
prophets. Farel, observing this, persevered, and encouraged
his disciple by the recollection of the great
dangers they had once incurred together. 'My dear
Froment,' he said, 'you fear the men of Geneva; but
were you not with me when I planted the Gospel at
Bienne, among the mountains, in the valley of Saint
Imier, at Tavannes, and near that mountain (Pierre
Pertuis) which Julius Cæsar tunnelled?... Were you
not with me when I went to Neuchatel and preached
in the streets and market-place, and in the surrounding
villages? Do you not remember that we very
often received our rent (<i>censes</i>), that is, blows and
abuse ... once in particular at Valengin, where my
blood remained for more than four years on the pavement
of a little chapel, near which the women and
priests bruised my head against the walls, so that we
were both of us nearly killed?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_535" id="Ref_535" href="#Foot_535">[535]</a></span>
These remembrances
were not very encouraging. Some sided with
Farel, others thought that a man of twenty-two was
too young to be launched into such a terrible gulf
... for Geneva really alarmed them. Froment could
not yet make up his mind to attempt the enterprise.
Another thought absorbed Farel.</p>

<p class="side">=OLIVETAN'S SCRUPLES OVERCOME.=</p>

<p>That pious reformer's heart was still full of the
glorious synod of the valleys at which it had been
decided to translate the Bible. He had several times
already entreated Olivetan to undertake that great
work: he repeated his entreaties both in the assembly
and in private. Near Yvonand there is a number of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">{359}</a></span>
hills which form a sort of labyrinth around a little
river. Beautiful forests of majestic oaks stretch
their branches so wide and high that it is possible to
walk beneath their immense leafy arches—a circumstance
which has earned for this district the name of
Arcadia. Was it in a private room or in these woods
that Farel urged Olivetan, as they trampled underfoot
the dry leaves which autumn had already loosened
from the trees? I cannot tell: in either case he no
longer solicited, he 'importuned;'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_536" id="Ref_536" href="#Foot_536">[536]</a></span>
but Olivetan—like
Froment with respect to Geneva—repeated his
unwillingness to 'venture' upon such a task. 'How,'
said he, 'can I express Hebrew and Greek eloquence
in French, which is but a barbarous language compared
with them? You know it is as difficult as to
teach the hoarse raven to sing the song of the nightingale.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_537" id="Ref_537" href="#Foot_537">[537]</a></span>
Farel tried to encourage him: he might do
it. Olivetan's style is, considering the time, one of remarkable
elegance. But Calvin's cousin alleged other
reasons: he had certain fears. 'Such an undertaking,'
he said, 'is like a ball in a public building wherein
everybody dances as he likes. I shall be encompassed
with critics, correctors, and calumniators.... They
will not be friends, I am very sure, but strangers
devoid of charity, Christians who will philosophise
about the dot over an <i>i</i>, and bring forward a thousand
false imputations.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_538" id="Ref_538" href="#Foot_538">[538]</a></span>—'St.
Jerome undertook
a similar work,' said Farel. 'St. Jerome!' exclaimed
Olivetan, 'he had more trouble in answering such
people than in all his work. How could I do it—I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">{360}</a></span>
who am but a petty page, a mere varlet, compared
with such a knight?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_539" id="Ref_539" href="#Foot_539">[539]</a></span>
But Farel pressed him so
much that he thought himself bound to undertake it.
He promised, and it was well known that what he
promised he would perform.</p>

<p>Farel had won a great victory. The French
churches would have a good translation of scripture.
But a journey was necessary. 'Cross the Alps,' he
said to his friend; 'go to the Waldensian valleys, and
come to an understanding with the brethren about
the translation.' Then turning towards other members
of the synod, he added: 'And you, Adam Martin
and Guido, go with him and preach to them the doctrine
that will correct all their errors.'</p>

<p>This mission, which was to result in the publication
of the Bible in French, was not without importance or
without danger. The evangelists proposed to take
the direct road by Mount St. Bernard; but before
reaching the lake of Geneva they would have to cross
a district belonging to the Duke of Savoy. Now the
duke, the Count of Challans, and the Sieur de Bellegarde
were not at all anxious that the Waldensians of
the Piedmontese valleys should unite with the reformers
of Switzerland. The four friends determined,
therefore, to travel by night. Having supped at
Yvonand with Farel and the other brethren, they
began their journey immediately after. It was at the
end of October. They travelled through the darkness,
led by a guide who knew the country well.
They successfully accomplished their night journey,
and arrived at Vevey the next day before dinner-time.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">{361}</a></span>
They began immediately to speak of Christ, for they
had no wish to fall into sloth and carelessness.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_540" id="Ref_540" href="#Foot_540">[540]</a></span>
From Vevey they proceeded to Aigle, where they
found the evangelical Christians of the place assembled
to receive them. 'I salute you in Christ,' said Adam,
'and exhort you to reprove one another as becomes
brethren and ministers of the word of truth.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_541" id="Ref_541" href="#Foot_541">[541]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=A MINISTER'S HOME.=</p>

<p>When they had almost reached the pretty village of
Bex, in the midst of its orchards and walnut trees,
in front of the picturesque Dent de Morcles, and the
huge Dent du Midi, Martin was attacked with severe
pains. His companions immediately looked for a
house where they could lodge the sick man, but the
country was so poor that they could not find a room
fit to receive him.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_542" id="Ref_542" href="#Foot_542">[542]</a></span>
These poor brethren were on the
highway with their suffering friend, anxious and yet
not knowing what to do. Some one told them that
about a league behind them, at the village of Ollon, lived
the minister Claude who would gladly receive them.
They accordingly retraced their steps, and arrived at
Ollon, a little place in the midst of the shady woods
which extend to the foot of the mountain on which
are situated the charming hamlets of Chesières and
Villars. They asked for the pastor's house and it
was shown them; they dragged their friend to it and
knocked at the door. Claude opened it himself, and
at the sight of a pale and fainting man invited the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">{362}</a></span>
strangers in. But on a sudden hasty footsteps were
heard, a woman appeared flushed with anger and with
fiery eyes—a violent, wicked, pitiless, scolding woman:
she was the unfortunate pastor's wife. She screamed
and gesticulated, and instead of being grave, as Scripture
requires such women to be, she forgot all restraint
and broke out: 'What's this, a sick man? If you
receive him into the house, I will leave it.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_543" id="Ref_543" href="#Foot_543">[543]</a></span>
Claude durst not say a word: the voice of this Xantippe
rose higher and higher, and at last she turned her back
on her husband and the strangers, and disappeared in a passion.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_544" id="Ref_544" href="#Foot_544">[544]</a></span>
Poor Claude was sorely vexed and ashamed.
'We will not be the cause of a divorce,' said Adam,
'we will go away.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_545" id="Ref_545" href="#Foot_545">[545]</a></span>
The pastor, a good but weak
man, who could not keep his wife in order, let them go.</p>

<p class="side">=THE SUFFERING MISSIONARIES.=</p>

<p>Thus not a house was opened to receive an expiring
missionary. The poor evangelists were quite disheartened.
'Let us cheer up,' said they, 'and make
haste to reach the Alps.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_546" id="Ref_546" href="#Foot_546">[546]</a></span>
The four travellers resumed
their journey, Martin probably on horseback; but
on arriving at the foot of the mountain beyond Martigny
his pains increased. Martin was half dead,
Olivetan suffered from an inflammation of the bowels,
Guido was exhausted with fatigue, and Adam alone
was unaffected. But ere long he too was attacked.
Seized with cholera (it is his own word<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_547" id="Ref_547" href="#Foot_547">[547]</a></span>)
he thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">{363}</a></span>
his end was come. The four missionaries dragged
themselves painfully along the brink of the torrent,
whose noisy waters alone disturbed the silence around
them. They lifted their eyes mournfully towards
those gigantic mountains which it seemed impossible
for them to cross, and ineffectually sought a refuge in
the poorest of cottages. One thing, however, was
left them—the faithfulness of their Master. They
said to one another: 'God takes us down into the
abyss when He pleases, but His grace is almighty to
lift us out of it again.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_548" id="Ref_548" href="#Foot_548">[548]</a></span>
At this moment they caught
sight of a wretched house. They went up to it, explained
their condition, and happily they were received
in consideration of their money. God, whom they had
invoked, alleviated their disorder, and the next day
they were able to resume their journey, feebly at
starting, but gradually the mountain air gave them
strength.</p>

<p>They had been forced to incur extraordinary expenses,
and Adam, who held the purse, smiled as he
saw its shrunken condition. Their good humour began
to return: he showed his friends the lean little bag,
and said merrily: 'Alas! our purse has been seized
with such cruel pains in the inside that there is
scarcely anything left in it.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_549" id="Ref_549" href="#Foot_549">[549]</a></span>
They climbed the
mountain, and needing rest entered an inn situated
between Martigny and the convent of St. Bernard.
They soon observed one of the monks, and approaching
him desired in spite of their weakness to discharge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">{364}</a></span>
their duty: they spoke to him of Jesus Christ, and of
the grace he gives to sinners. The monk, who belonged
to the Augustine order, listened attentively to
their words, and began to talk with them, while the
evangelists pressed him closely by means of the Holy
Scriptures. He was touched and convinced. 'I will
quit Antichrist,' he exclaimed. Adam immediately
took paper, sat down and wrote: 'Here is a letter for
Master Farel,' he said to the friar, 'go to him, and he
will tell you what you have to do.' The evangelist
and the monk separated. Even down to our days
conversions have been effected among the brethren of
this monastery.</p>

<p>At last the four friends arrived among the Waldenses,
who listened joyfully to their words of truth and love:
some of these Alpine shepherds were even known to
have gone two days' journey to hear them.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_550" id="Ref_550" href="#Foot_550">[550]</a></span>
These poor Christians handed over to Olivetan towards the
printing of the Bible 500 gold crowns—an immense
sum for them, and begged that the publication should
be hurried on.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_551" id="Ref_551" href="#Foot_551">[551]</a></span>
Olivetan and the barbes came to
terms. Here finishes this episode, which to some may
have little interest except so far as it is connected
with the history of the French protestant translation
of the Holy Scriptures.</p>

<p class="side">=DEPUTATION OF PEASANTS.=</p>

<p>When this news reached Farel, his eyes were fixed
upon another country. The young and gentle Fabri,
whom the reformer loved as a father loves a son, was
preaching at Neuchatel, when one day he saw some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">{365}</a></span>
peasants arrive who had been deputed from the village
of Bole in the parish of Boudry. These good people
entreated him to come and settle among them. The
parish priest, a worthy man by the way, looked upon
the Gospel not as a proclamation of grace, but as a
second law more perfect than the first. Having heard
the reformers inveigh against the corruption that prevailed
in the church, he had at first gone with them;
but he soon hesitated and shrunk back, when he found
that their new morality reposed on a new faith. In
fact the ministers who preached in those quarters said
that the Gospel substituted a regenerative doctrine for
the dead ordinances of the law; that Christ's religion
did not consist in practices commanded by the priests,
or even in a purely outward morality, but in a new
heart from which proceeds a new life. 'The law,'
said Calvin in later years, 'is like grammar, which
after it has taught the first elements, refers the learners
to theology or some other science, in order that they
may be perfected.' The priest of Boudry would have
thought himself but too happy to see his parishioners
endowed with that external morality which did not
satisfy the evangelicals. A zealous doctor of the law,
he turned against the doctors of grace, and hence it
happened that a few of his parishioners hastened to
Neuchatel.</p>

<p>Fabri followed these honest people, and the gentle
and moderate reformer was immediately engaged in a
severe campaign. The village of Bole was for the
reformer; the little town of Boudry for the priest.
There were two places of worship in the parish, the
church, and a chapel called the Pontareuse, situated in
a low out-of-the-way place. The government decided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">{366}</a></span>
that this should be for the use of both parties. Many
catholics, more fanatical than their priest, entered
into a plot to oppose the worship of the reformed.
On the first Sunday in November 1532, the latter
went down full of peace and joy into the wild valley
through which flows the torrent of the Reuse, and where
a few remains of the little chapel are still visible. They
entered and took their seats on the benches, while
Fabri went up into the pulpit. Meantime the catholics,
girding on their swords, which was not usually
done, entered the chapel and drew up near the altar.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_552" id="Ref_552" href="#Foot_552">[552]</a></span>
While Fabri was preaching, all the bells suddenly
rang out together so as to drown his voice, and the
more he besought them to let him finish, the louder
rang the catholics in the belfry. Then those who
were in the church began to move, pushing and
shouting. Fabri, seeing this disorder and profanation,
ceased speaking, and left the church. He had hardly
got outside when the catholics near the altar ran and
shut the door, and fell like madmen on the surprised,
hesitating, and unarmed congregation.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_553" id="Ref_553" href="#Foot_553">[553]</a></span>
The confusion was very great, and it was this that saved the
innocent. No one distinguished friends from enemies:
each man struck the first he met. One or two evangelicals
endeavoured to open the door, and at last
they succeeded and rushed out, but their position
was not bettered. 'Their adversaries, delighted at
being able to distinguish them,' says an eye-witness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">{367}</a></span>
'fell upon them like wolves upon lambs, threatening
them with death.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_554" id="Ref_554" href="#Foot_554">[554]</a></span>
'God help us!' exclaimed the
poor people scattered here and there. At last they
succeeded in reaching their homes, miraculously as it
were, but with many bruises. They were happy at
being in peace. 'Our heavenly Father fought for us
mightily,' they said.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_555" id="Ref_555" href="#Foot_555">[555]</a></span>
Clubs and swords only served
to increase their repugnance for that theocratical
tyranny which men had substituted for the mild
gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class="side">=A PROTESTANT RISING.=</p>

<p>The next day some of the reformed went to Neuchatel
against the advice of Fabri, who desired to
wait for deliverance from the Lord and not from men.
To the friends who met them on the road, they told
the story of the plot to which they had nearly been
victims. All the villages between Boudry and Neuchatel
were in commotion, and the peasants of Auvernier
and Colombier flew to arms, ready to join the
Neuchatelans if they went to the help of their brethren.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_556" id="Ref_556" href="#Foot_556">[556]</a></span>
The council of Neuchatel decreed that
henceforth the chapel of Pontareuse should belong
entirely to the reformed.</p>

<p>The catholics resolved to pay no attention to this. On
Christmas day the priest had already sung two masses
before the hour appointed for the evangelical preaching;
and at the moment when the reformers arrived, he
resolutely began high mass 'with loud and long singing,'
although there was scarcely anybody to hear it.
The reformed waited patiently, but when the service
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">{368}</a></span>
was ended, and just as they were hoping that their
turn had come, they were surprised to see the catholics
arriving in a crowd. Fabri then wanted to go
into the pulpit, but had great difficulty; one pushed
him one way, and one another, and all shouted out
against him.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_557" id="Ref_557" href="#Foot_557">[557]</a></span>
Order being a little restored, one of
the reformers went, as was customary, to take a
chalice for the celebration of the Lord's Supper. The
priest who had remained in the church, watching
what was going on, rushed upon him and snatched the
vessel from his hands, crying out, 'Sacrilege! Sacrilege!'
The friends of the priests determined to put an
end to the service once for all. 'Some of them rushed
like raging lions upon the reformed, and hit them
with their fists; and one of them struck a governor
(probably one of the communal councillors) with a
knife; but God,' says the document we quote, 'permitted
only his clothes to be pierced.' This did not
end the battle. Others, going to a room behind the
altar, where they had hidden some large sticks, dealt
their blows lustily on all sides. The women rushed
into the vineyards, tore up the vine-props, and brought
them to as many of their husbands as had neither
sticks nor knives. Some of them left the chapel and
picked up stones to throw at the minister, who was
still in the pulpit, and kill him. From every side
they fell upon the poor evangelicals, calling them
'Rascally dogs!' Even the <i>sautier</i> of Boudry, whose
duty it was to preserve order, joined in the riot, threw
off his official robe, and loudly hooting, struck harder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">{369}</a></span>
than the rest. The parish priest, who loved the law
so much, had suddenly lost his balance. Incensed,
and beside himself, stripped to his doublet, and 'bareheaded
like a brigand,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_558" id="Ref_558" href="#Foot_558">[558]</a></span>
he directed the battle. His
friends, well provided with arquebuses, bludgeons,
knives, and other weapons, seeing that the evangelists
had rallied round their pastor, rushed upon them, intending
to kill many of them; 'but it was God's will
that this wolf should be stopped on the way,' says the
official document, 'and be driven back into his den.'
The reformed, who parried the blows as well as they
could with their hands only, at last succeeded in
reaching their houses. They told their relations and
friends what had happened, and gave God thanks.
'It is indeed a great miracle,' they said with emotion,
'that there was nobody killed. But the Lord Jesus
Christ is a Good Shepherd; he keeps his sheep so
well in the midst of the sword, the fire, the lions,
and even death itself, that the wolves cannot snatch
them out of his hand.'</p>

<p class="side">=A PRIEST HEADS THE RIOT.=</p>

<p>While these songs of thanksgiving were being
sung in the houses of the evangelists, the curé was
triumphing in the church. The battle was scarcely
terminated by the retreat of the reformed, when,
proud of the victory he had won by stones and clubs,
he laid down the stake with which he had armed himself,
covered his head, arranged his disordered doublet,
put on his sacerdotal robes, and entered the church of
Boudry with a grave and composed air. Seeing it
full, and wishing to profit by the advantage he had
gained, he went into the pulpit and exclaimed in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">{370}</a></span>
burlesque manner: 'Some strangers have come of
their own accord into this country. One comes from
Paris, another from Lyons, and a third from I do not
know where. This one is called Master Anthony, that
one Master Berthoud, another Master William, a fourth
Master Froment (<i>i.e.</i> <i>wheat</i>) with <i>barley</i> or <i>oats</i>....
They carry a book in their hands and boast of having
the Holy Ghost. But if they had the Holy Ghost,
would they want a book? The apostles who were
filled with the Holy Ghost understood without book
all languages and all mysteries. My brethren, will you
believe a stranger before a man of the country whom
you know? Do not associate with those devils; they
will lead you into hell; but come to confession as
all your forefathers have done; open yourselves to me
upon the seven deadly sins, the five natural senses, and
the ten commandments. Do not be afraid; your consciences
will be cleansed of all evil. Put me to death
in case I do not prove all I have told you.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_559" id="Ref_559" href="#Foot_559">[559]</a></span>
The catholics left the church very proud of such a fine
discourse.</p>

<p class="side">=REFORM ADVANCES AT NEUCHATEL.=</p>

<p>Some of the friends of the reformed hurried off to
Fabri, and reported to him that the priest offered to
prove all he had said, particularly that he could absolve
from the seven deadly sins and those of the five senses.
Without loss of time Fabri appeared before the castellan
and councillors of Boudry, and asked for a public
disputation, offering to die in case he could not show
that all he had preached was true, and that what the
priest had said was false. The latter bluntly refused
all public discussion; he did not like combats of that
kind, and compensated himself in another fashion.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">{371}</a></div>

<p>One day, as he sat half undressed at his window
watching the birds as they darted through the air, and
the people who were walking in the street, he saw
Fabri passing in front of his house. In great excitement
he called to him and began abusing him:
'Gaol-bird! forger!' he said, stretching his head out
of window; 'tell me why you corrupt Holy Scripture?'
Fabri, hoping the curé would grant him the discussion
he had so much desired, made answer: 'Come
down and bring out your Bible; we will take a clerk
who can read it to the people, and I will show you that
I am no forger.' At these words the alarmed priest exclaimed:
'I have something else to do besides disputing
with a gaol-bird like you;' and he retired hastily
from the window. Such were the struggles the
reformers had to go through in order to transform the
church. This transformation was going on, and ere
long the whole principality of Neuchatel was won to
the Reformation.</p>

<p>In 1532 it penetrated into the mountain regions
among the shepherds and hunters of Locle and Chaux
de Fonds. Claude d'Arberg, who had so often followed
the chase in these mountains, had built an oratory
there to St. Hubert, the hunters' patron saint. The
saint (says the legend) was once met by a bear, which
killed his horse, but Hubert got on the bear's back, and
rode him home to the great astonishment of everybody.
A more formidable hunter was now about to tame
the bears of these parts. Jean de Bély, the evangelist
of Fontaine, having gone to Locle at the time of
the fair of St. Magdalen, Madame Guillemette de Vergy
had him seized instantly and forced him to dispute for
two hours in her presence with the curé, Messire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">{372}</a></span>
Besancenet. 'Put him in prison,' said the countess,
who was offended at his doctrines; but whilst the high-born
dame was so irritated at what she had heard,
the priest, a good-natured man, interceded in the
kindest manner in favour of the heretic. The lady released
him, and the worthy vicar, taking Bély by the
arm, led him graciously to the parsonage, and drank
wine with him. Already people said that the mountain
bears were beginning to be tamed.</p>

<p>From Locle the Gospel made its way to Chaux de
Fonds, and thence to Brenets (1534). The earnest
mountaineers had taken the images out of the church,
desiring to <i>worship God in spirit and in truth</i>, and
were preparing to break them in pieces and throw them
into the Doubs, when they saw two fine oxen approaching,
driven by some devout inhabitants from a
neighbouring village of Franche Comté. 'We offer
you these beasts,' said they, 'in exchange for your
pictures and statues.'—'Pray take them,' said the
people of Brenets. The Franche-Comtois gathered up
the idols, the Neuchatelans drove away the oxen, and
'each thought they had made a fine exchange,' says a
chronicler.</p>

<p>With the exception of one village, the evangelical
faith was established throughout the whole principality
of Neuchatel, without the aid of the prince and the
lords, and indeed in spite of them. A hand mightier
than theirs was breaking the bonds, removing the
obstacles, and emancipating souls. The Reformation
triumphed: and after God, it was Farel's work.<span

<p class="side">=FRESH ATTEMPTS UPON GENEVA.=</p>

<p class="drop-cap">FAREL, seeing his labours in these different localities
crowned with a success that promised to be
lasting, turned his eyes with all the more ardour to
Geneva. The numerous victories of Neuchatel and
Vaud seemed to augur new ones to be gained in the
city of the huguenots. There were, however, great
obstacles. A fanatical party, directed by monks and
priests, was opposed to all change, and even the enlightened
catholics, who desired the abolition of crying
abuses, kept repeating that the church ought first of
all to be maintained, and then reformed. 'A purification
is not enough,' said Farel; 'a transformation is
wanted.' But who was to bring it about? He had
been banished from Geneva, and for a time could not
return there.</p>

<p>Froment, young, poor, simple-minded, but intelligent,
had refused to undertake so difficult a task. Farel
tried once more. Froment did not understand how
the attack of one of the strongest fortresses of the
enemy could be entrusted to so young a man.
'Fear nothing,' said Farel; 'you will find men in
Geneva quite ready to receive you, and your very
obscurity will protect you. God will be your guide,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">{374}</a></span>
and will guard your holy enterprise.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_561" id="Ref_561" href="#Foot_561">[561]</a></span>
Froment yielded, but felt humbled; and reflecting on the task
entrusted to him, he fell on his knees: 'O God,' he said,
'I trust in no human power, but place myself entirely
in thy hands. To thee I commit my cause, praying
thee to guide it, for it is thine.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_562" id="Ref_562" href="#Foot_562">[562]</a></span>
He did not pray
alone. The little flock at Yvonand, affected at this call
which was about to take away their pastor, said:
'O God, give him grace to be useful for the advancement
of thy Word!' The brethren embraced, and
Froment departed, 'going to Geneva,' he tells us,
'with prayers and blessings.' It was the 1st November
1532.</p>

<p>He reached Lausanne, whence he took his way along
the shore of the lake towards Geneva. The poor young
man stopped sometimes on the road, and asked himself
whether the enterprise he was about to attempt was
not sheer madness. 'No,' he said, 'I will not shrink
back; for it is by the small and weak things of this
world that God designs to confound the great.' And
then he resumed his journey.</p>

<p>The Genevese were much occupied at that time
with signs in the heaven. A strange blaze shone in
the firmament; every night their eyes were fixed upon
a long train of light, and the most learned endeavoured
to divine the prognostics to be drawn from it. 'At
the new moon,' says a manuscript, 'there appeared a
comet, at two in the morning, which was visible from
the 26th September to the 14th of the following month.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">{375}</a></span>
About this time Anthony Froment arrived in Geneva.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_563" id="Ref_563" href="#Foot_563">[563]</a></span>
Many huguenots, irritated at the reception given to
Farel, despaired of seeing Geneva reformed, and its
liberties settled on a firm basis. Some, however, who
were adepts in astronomy, wondered whether that
marvellous sheen did not foretel that a divine light
would also illuminate the country. They waited, and
Froment appeared.</p>

<p class="side">=FROMENT COLDLY RECEIVED.=</p>

<p>The young Dauphinese was at first much embarrassed.
He tried to enter into conversation with one
and another, but they were very short with the stranger.
He hoped to find 'some acquaintance with whom he
could retire safely and familiarly;' but he saw none
but strange faces. 'Alas!' he said, 'I cannot tell what
to do, except it be to return, for I find no door to
preach the Gospel.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_564" id="Ref_564" href="#Foot_564">[564]</a></span>
Then, calling to mind the names
of the chief huguenots, friends of Farel, who (as he
said) would give him the warmest welcome, Froment
resolved to apply to them, and waited upon Baudichon
de la Maison-Neuve, Claude Bernard, J. Goulaz,
Vandel, and Ami Perrin, ... but strange to say he
everywhere met with embarrassed manners and long
faces. The mean appearance of the young Dauphinese
disconcerted even the best disposed. Farel (they
thought) might at least have sent a scholar, and not a
working man. Geneva was an important and learned
city. There were men of capacity among the Roman
clergy, who must be opposed by a minister of good
appearance, a well-established doctor.... The huguenots
bowed out the mean little man. 'Ah!' said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">{376}</a></span>
Froment, returning to his inn, 'I found them so cold,
so timid, and so startled at what had been done to
Farel and his companions, that they dared not unbosom
themselves, and still less receive me into their houses.'
Confounded and dejected at seeing all his plans overthrown,
he walked thoughtfully through the streets
with his eyes bent on the ground. He entered the
inn, shut himself up in his room, and asked himself
what was to be done next. Those who seemed to wish
to hear the Gospel looked at him with contemptuous
eyes. If he spoke to any persons, they turned their
backs on him. Not one door was opened to the Word
of God.... His feelings were soured. Wearied and
dejected he sank under the weight, and lost courage.
'I am greatly tempted to go back,' he said.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_565" id="Ref_565" href="#Foot_565">[565]</a></span></p>

<p>Froment went to the landlord, paid his bill, strapped
his little bundle on his shoulders, and, without taking
leave of the huguenots, bent his steps towards the
Swiss gate, and quitted the city. But he had not
gone many yards before he stopped; he felt as if he
were detained by an invisible hand; a voice was heard
in his conscience, telling him he was doing wrong; a
force greater than that of man compelled him to retrace
his steps. He returned to his room, shut the
door, and sat down; leaning on the table with his head
in his hands, he asked what God wanted with him.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_566" id="Ref_566" href="#Foot_566">[566]</a></span>
He began to pray, and seemed to witness in himself the
realisation of the promise: <i>I will lead thee in the way
in which thou shouldst walk</i>. He called to mind what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">{377}</a></span>
Farel had told him, and what the reformer had done
at Aigle. A flash of light illumined his soul. They
will have nothing to do with him in Geneva, because
his appearance is mean. Be it so; he will undertake
with humility the work that God gives him; and since
he is rejected as an evangelist, he will turn schoolmaster.</p>

<p class="side">=FROMENT ADVERTISES HIS SCHOOL.=</p>

<p>During his walks Froment had met with one Le
Patu, a man but little known, whom he asked if he
could procure for him a place for a school. Le Patu
answered that there was the great hall at Boytet's, at
the Croix d'Or, near the Molard.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_567" id="Ref_567" href="#Foot_567">[567]</a></span>
They went there
together; Froment measured its dimensions with his
eye, and hired the room. He breathed again; he had
now one foot in the stirrup; it only remained to get
into the saddle, and begin his course. It was necessary
to find scholars; with God's help Froment despaired of
nothing. Returning to the inn, he drew up a prospectus,
made several copies in his best handwriting,
went out with them, and posted them in all the public
places. They ran as follows: 'A man has just arrived
in this city who engages to teach reading and writing
in French, in one month, to all who will come to him,
young and old, men and women, even such as have
never been to school; and if they cannot read and
write within the said month, he asks nothing for his
trouble. He will be found at Boytet's large room, near
the Molard, at the sign of the Croix d'Or. Many
diseases are also cured gratis.'</p>

<p>These papers having been posted about the city,
many of the passers-by stopped to read them. 'We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">{378}</a></span>
have heard him speak,' said some with whom he had
conversed; 'he talks well.' Others thought that the
promise to teach reading and writing in a month was
suspicious; to which more benevolent men replied,
that in any case he did not aim at their purses. But
the priests and devout were irritated. 'He is a devil,'
said a priest in the crowd; 'he enchants all who go
near him. You have hardly heard him before his
magical words bewilder you.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_568" id="Ref_568" href="#Foot_568">[568]</a></span></p>

<p>The school opened, however, and he did not want
for young pupils. Froment, who had talent (his book
of the <i>Actes et Gestes de Genève</i> proves this), taught
with simplicity and clearness. Before dismissing his
scholars he would open the New Testament and
read a few verses, explaining them in an interesting
manner; after which (as he had some knowledge of
medicine) he would ask them whether any in their
families were sick, and distribute harmless remedies
among them. It was by the instruction of the mind
and the healing of the body that the evangelist paved
the way to the conversion of the heart. The school
and medicine are great missionary auxiliaries. The
children ran home and told their parents all; the
mothers stopped in their work to listen to them, and
the fathers, especially the huguenots, made them
tell it again. Some of the boys and girls were continually
prattling about it; they even 'accosted men
and women in the streets, inviting them to come and
hear <i>that man</i>.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_569" id="Ref_569" href="#Foot_569">[569]</a></span>
In a short time the city was full of
the schoolmaster who spoke French so well.</p>

<div><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">{379}</a></div>

<p class="side">=FROMENT'S SUCCESS.=</p>

<p>Several adults resolved to hear him, either from a
desire to learn, or from curiosity, or in sport. Wives,
however, stopped their husbands; jesters played off
their jokes, and priests uttered their anathemas. But
nothing could stop the current, for people thought
the schoolmaster would speak against the lives of the
priests, the mass, and Lent.... These worthy huguenots,
as they passed through the streets, heard 'numerous
loud jests and whispered hints' around them.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_570" id="Ref_570" href="#Foot_570">[570]</a></span>
They took their places behind the children and listened.
Froment began: 'He speaks well,' said his hearers.
He did even more than he had promised; he taught
arithmetic, which was very acceptable to the Genevese,
who are by nature rather calculating. It was the
sermon, however, which the hearers waited for, and
that was very different from what they had expected—a
homily instead of a philippic. In the course of
his lessons Froment read at one time a story from the
Bible, at another one of our Lord's sermons, giving
the Scripture as the Scriptures of God, explaining as
he went on the difficult words, and then applying the
doctrine affectionately to the consciences of his hearers.
They were all ears; leaning forward and with half-opened
mouth, each one seemed afraid of losing a word.
A few boys turned glances of triumph on those whom
they had brought there. Froment joyfully marked
the effect produced by his teaching. 'They were
much astonished, for they had never heard such doctrine.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_571" id="Ref_571" href="#Foot_571">[571]</a></span>
Some began to understand that evangelical
Christianity did not consist in mocking the priests
and the mass, but in knowing and loving the Saviour.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">{380}</a></span>
'Those who heard him conceived in their hearts some
understanding of the truth.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_572" id="Ref_572" href="#Foot_572">[572]</a></span></p>

<p>In a short time the success of this simple instruction
surpassed the hopes of the teacher. Those who
had heard him talked of the beautiful discourses
delivered at the Croix d'Or. 'Come,' said they,
'for he preaches very differently from the priests,
and asks nothing for his trouble.'—'Good,' said some
citizens more ignorant than the rest; 'we will go and
hear him; we will learn to read and write, and hear
what he says.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_573" id="Ref_573" href="#Foot_573">[573]</a></span>
Men, women, and children hastened
to the hall, striving which should be there first.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_574" id="Ref_574" href="#Foot_574">[574]</a></span>
The poor man whom the Genevans had repulsed had
suddenly grown in their estimation. The disputes
between huguenots and mamelukes, the claims of the
Duke of Savoy and Bishop De la Baume were forgotten;
nothing was thought of but the evangelist. At the
epoch of the Reformation nothing was more striking
than the great difference between the instruction
given by the priests and that given by the reformers.
'Their teaching,' it was said, 'is not such a cold,
meagre, lifeless thing as that of popery. True, our
masters sing loud enough, and preach whatever pleases
their patrons, but they chirp out divine things in a
profane manner; their discourses have no reverence
for God, and are full of fine words and affectation....
In the others, on the contrary, instead of mere words
and idle talk, there is virtue and efficaciousness, a
life-giving spirit and divine power.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_575" id="Ref_575" href="#Foot_575">[575]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">{381}</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE BEWITCHED.=</p>

<p>The friends of the priests could not hear such remarks
without feeling the deepest alarm. 'Pshaw!'
they said, 'you speak as if the man had enchanted
you. By what sounds, figures, or magical operations
has he bewitched you? Or is it else by fine
words, great promises, or other means of seduction
... by money?' From that time if they saw in
the street a man or woman who attended the meetings
at the Croix d'Or, they would cry out: 'Ho! ho!
there goes one of the possessed!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_576" id="Ref_576" href="#Foot_576">[576]</a></span>
Complaints were
made and bitter reproaches: signs of disapprobation
were heard; but 'notwithstanding all this contrary
movement the number of hearers increased daily.
Many of those whom curiosity had attracted were
interested, enlightened, and touched, and returning
home they praised and glorified God.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_577" id="Ref_577" href="#Foot_577">[577]</a></span></p>

<p>All were not, however, won over to the Gospel.
Certain huguenot leaders, Ami Perrin, John Goulaz,
Stephen d'Adda, and others, took no great pleasure
in the preacher's sermons; but believing that this new
doctrine, which fell from the skies, would overthrow
the dominion of the priests and mamelukes, they did
not hesitate to range themselves among Froment's
hearers, and to support him energetically in the city.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_578" id="Ref_578" href="#Foot_578">[578]</a></span>
Ere long matters went still worse for Rome. Some
of Froment's hearers invited certain priests who were
liberally inclined, to come and hear the schoolmaster.
The idea of sitting on the benches at the Croix d'Or
alarmed these churchmen, the huguenots repeated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">{382}</a></span>
the Frenchman's words: 'Truly,' said the priests,
'these doctrines are good, and we should do well to
receive them.'—'Ho! ho!' said certain of the citizens,
'the clerks who made such a brag are now converted
themselves.'</p>

<p>The alarm increased. The most bigoted monks and
priests entered private houses, addressed the groups
assembled in the public places, and jeered at Froment's
doctrine and person. 'Will you go and hear
that devil?' they said; 'what can that little fool
(<i>folaton</i>) know who is hardly twenty-two?'—'That
fool,' answered Froment's admirers, 'will teach you
to be wise.... That devil will cast out the devil
that is in you.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_579" id="Ref_579" href="#Foot_579">[579]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=CLAUDINE LEVET.=</p>

<p>In truth an astonishing work was going on in
Geneva at this time; many souls were gained to the
evangelical faith, and as in the times of the apostles,
it was the women of distinction who believed first,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_580" id="Ref_580" href="#Foot_580">[580]</a></span>
Paula, the wife of John Levet, and probably the
same as Pernetta of Bourdigny, was daughter of the
lord of Bourdigny, in the <i>mandement</i> of Peney. The
members of this house had been styled nobles or
<i>damoiseaux</i> as far back as the thirteenth century,
and many of them had been syndics of Geneva.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_581" id="Ref_581" href="#Foot_581">[581]</a></span>
This lady, prepared by the teachings of the evangelists
who had preceded Froment, 'had become
very zealous for the Word,' and earnestly desired
to bring to the Gospel her sister-in-law Claudine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">{383}</a></span>
wife of a worthy citizen, Aimé Levet. The latter,
'an honest, devoted, and wondrously superstitious
woman,' was upright and sincere, and more than
once had combatted zealously her sister's opinions.
One day when Paula was at Claudine's house, she
conjured her to come and hear the schoolmaster. 'I
have so great a horror of him,' replied her sister-in-law,
'that for fear of being bewitched, I will neither
see nor hear him.'—'He speaks like an angel,' answered
Paula. 'I look upon him as a devil,' retorted
Claudine. 'If you hear him, you will be saved.'—'And
I think I shall be damned.' Thus contended
these two women. Paula was not discouraged. 'At
least hear him once,' she said, and then added with
emotion: 'Pray hear him once for love of me!' She
prevailed at last, though with great difficulty.</p>

<p>Dame Claudine, although yielding to her sister's
entreaties, resolved to protect herself thoroughly.
She armed herself carefully with all the antidotes
provided in such cases; she fastened fresh-gathered
rosemary leaves to her temples, rubbed her bosom
with virgin wax,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_582" id="Ref_582" href="#Foot_582">[582]</a></span>
hung relics, crosses, and rosaries
round her neck, and shielded by these amulets, she
accompanied Paula to the Croix d'Or. 'I am going
to see an enchanter,' she said, so deceived<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_583" id="Ref_583" href="#Foot_583">[583]</a></span>
was she. She promised herself to lead back the Demoiselle de
Bourdigny into the fold.</p>

<p>Claudine entered the hall and sat down in front of
the magician in mockery and derision, says the chronicle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">{384}</a></span>
Froment appeared, having a book in his hand.
He mounted on a round table, as was his custom, in
order to be better heard, and opening the New Testament,
read a few words, and then began to apply
them. Claudine, without caring the least for the
assembly, and wishing to make her catholicism known,
crossed herself several times on the breast, at the
same time repeating certain prayers. Froment continued
his discourse and unfolded the treasures of the
Gospel. Claudine raised her eyes at last, astonished
at what she heard, and looked at the minister. She
listened, and ere long there was not a more attentive
hearer in all the congregation. Froment's voice alone
would have been 'wasted,' but it entered into the
woman's understanding, as if borne by the Spirit of
God. She drank in the reformer's words; and yet a
keen struggle was going on within her. Can this
doctrine be true, seeing that the church says nothing
about it? she asked herself. Her eyes often fell on
the schoolmaster's book. It was not a missal or a
breviary.... It seemed to her full of life.</p>

<p class="side">=CLAUDINE ALONE WITH THE BIBLE.=</p>

<p>Froment having completed his sermon, the children
and adults rose and prepared to go out. Claudine
remained in her place: she looked at the teacher, and
at last exclaimed aloud: 'Is it true what you say?'—'Yes,'
answered the reformer. 'Is it all proved by
the Gospel?'—'Yes.'—'Is not the mass mentioned in
it?'—'No!'—'And is the book from which you preached
a genuine New Testament?'—'Yes.' Madame Levet
eagerly desired to have it: taking courage, she said:
'Then lend it me.' Froment gave it to her, and
Claudine placing it carefully under her cloak, among
her relics and beads, went out with her sister-in-law,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">{385}</a></span>
who was beginning to see all her wishes accomplished.
As Claudine returned home she did not talk much
with Paula: hers was one of those deep natures that
speak little with man but much with God. Entering
her house, she went straight to her room and shut
herself in, taking nothing but the book with her, and
being determined not to come out again until she had
found the solution of the grand problem with which
her conscience was occupied. On which side is truth?
At Rome or at Wittemberg? Having made arrangements
that they should not wait meals for her, or
knock at her door, 'she remained apart,' says Froment,
'for three days and three nights without eating
or drinking, but with prayers, fasting, and supplication.'
The book lay open on the table before her.
She read it constantly, and falling on her knees, asked
for the divine light to be shed abroad in her heart.
Claudine probably did not possess an understanding
of the highest range, but she had a tender conscience.
With her the first duty was to submit to God, the
first want to resemble Him, the first desire to find
everlasting happiness in Him. She did not reach Christ
through the understanding; conscience was the path
that led her to Him. An awakening conscience is the
first symptom of conversion and consequently of reformation.
Sometimes Claudine heard in her heart
a voice pressing her to come to Jesus; then her
superstitious ideas would suddenly return, and she
rejected the Lord's invitation. But she soon discovered
that the practices to which she had abandoned
herself were dried-up wells where there had never
been any water. Determined to go astray no longer,
she desired to go straight to Christ. It was then she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">{386}</a></span>
redoubled those 'prayers and supplications' of which
Froment speaks, and read the Holy Scriptures with
eagerness. At last she understood that divine Word
which spake: 'Daughter, thy sins are forgiven thee.'
Oh, wonderful, she is saved! This salvation did not
puff her up: she discovered that 'the grace of God
trickled slowly into her;' but the least drop coming
from the Holy Spirit seemed a well that never dried.
Three days were thus spent: for the same space of
time Paul remained in prayer at Damascus.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_584" id="Ref_584" href="#Foot_584">[584]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=HER CONVERSION.=</p>

<p>Madame Levet having read the Gospel again and
again desired to see the man who had first led
her to know it. She sent for him. Froment
crossed the Rhone, for she lived at the foot of the
bridge, on the side of St. Gervais. He entered,
and when she saw him Claudine rose in emotion,
approached him, and being unable to speak burst into
tears. 'Her tears,' says the evangelist, 'fell on the
floor,' she had no other language. When she recovered,
Madame Levet courteously begged Froment
to sit down, and told him how God had opened to her
the door of heaven. At the same time she showed
herself determined to profess without fear before men
the faith that caused her happiness. 'Ah!' she said,
'can I ever thank God sufficiently for having enlightened
me?' Froment had come to strengthen this
lady and he was himself strengthened. He was
in great admiration at 'hearing her speak as she did.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_585" id="Ref_585" href="#Foot_585">[585]</a></span>
A conversion so spiritual and so serious
must needs have a great signification for the Reformation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">{387}</a></span>
of Geneva, and as Calvin says in other circumstances
where also only one woman seems to have
been converted: 'From this tiny shoot an excellent
church was to spring.'<span

<p class="drop-cap">WHILE the Gospel was thus manifesting its power
in Geneva, the bishop persisted in his inflexible
hostility. The Genevan magistrates still felt great
regard for him. On the 13th December 1532 the
council sent a deputation to him to obtain his consent
to a tax which was deemed to be necessary: the Sieur
de Chapeaurouge, the ex-captain-general Philippe,
and others appeared respectfully before him. Love of
order and the obedience due to established authority
were characteristics of the Genevese statesmen, and
vexed as they were at the abuses which had their
source in the power of the bishop, they could not
take upon themselves to do anything without his consent.
The bishop, flattered with these attentions,
made the deputation very welcome for a couple of
days, but on the third all his bad humour returned.
When the ambassadors appeared before him again he
said hastily: 'I will grant you nothing, not a single
crown, and I will compel my lords of Geneva to ask
my pardon on their bended knees.' On the 26th
December the deputation reported this language to
the council, who were annoyed at it; and while the
bishop was sending these messages to Geneva which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">{389}</a></span>
did not advance the cause of popery, the Reformation,
on the contrary, was endeavouring in every way to
enlighten men's minds and win their hearts.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_587" id="Ref_587" href="#Foot_587">[587]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=PROGRESS OF THE GOSPEL.=</p>

<p>Froment being in communication with Farel and
the reformed of Switzerland, received from them
Testaments, tracts, and controversial works, which his
friends and he distributed all over the city, where they
were read with eagerness. Every day more persons
were won over to the evangelical faith. They were of
all conditions of life. A certain tradesman, named
Guérin, a cap-maker, listened while working in his
shop to all that was said around him, and thought
seriously of religion and of the abuses of popery. One
day he determined to visit the Croix d'Or, and the
words he heard there touched his heart and enlightened
his mind. Being sensible, intelligent, modest,
and of decided character, he gave himself up with all
his heart to God's cause, and ere long became Froment's
helper. There were also persons of all ages
among the converts. Claude Bernard had a daughter
between seven and eight years old whom he early
introduced to the knowledge of scripture. The child's
precocious understanding was struck with certain
simple and clear passages which condemned the popular
superstitions; and the little controversialist (we
are told) confounded the ignorant priests. Unable to
answer her they spread a report that she was possessed
of the devil. A Frenchman of distinction, passing
through Geneva, wished to see her, and was charmed
with her infantile graces and piety.</p>

<p>It was soon apparent that there was something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">{390}</a></span>
more than a new doctrine: a moral reformation
accompanied the revival of faith. In the days of her
bigoted Catholicism Claudine Levet had been very
fond of dress; her conscience now reproached her with
having been unreasonable in her love of costly attire,
and more eager to ornament her body than to adorn
her soul. One day she shut herself up in that room
where she had heard the call of God, stripped off
(says Froment) 'all superfluous bravery (<i>braveté</i>), laid
aside those ornaments and trappings which had only
served to show her off in a vainglorious way, as a peacock
spreads his tail,' and from that time she wore a
plain and becoming dress. Having sold her beautiful
robes and other belongings, she gave the money to
the poor, particularly to the evangelicals of France,
who having been banished from their homes on account
of truth had come to Geneva. All her life she loved
to receive refugees in her house. 'Verily,' they said
of her, 'verily, she follows the example of Tabitha who
was called Dorcas (Acts ix.), and deserves to be kept
in perpetual remembrance.'</p>

<p>Claudine did more than this: she spoke frankly and
meekly of the precious truth she had received, and
'scattered it wherever she happened to be in the city.'
The priests alarmed at such an astonishing transformation
endeavoured to bring her back to the practices
of the church; but Claudine 'showed them tenderly
by scripture what was necessary' (namely, faith and
charity). All in the city were surprised to hear her
talk as she did.<span

<p>The news of her conversion made a great sensation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">{391}</a></span>
particularly among the Genevese ladies. One day, when
the most worldly of them had met together, they
talked of nothing but Madame Levet and her estrangement
from the mass and from amusements. They were
Pernette Balthasarde, wife of a councillor; the wife of
Baudichon de la Maison neuve; the wife of Claude
Pastor, Jeanne Marie de Fernex, and many other rich
and honourable ladies.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_589" id="Ref_589" href="#Foot_589">[589]</a></span>
'Alas!' they said, 'how is
it that she has changed in so short a time?' They
had loved her, and all the more regretted that she was
<i>lost</i>.... They vented their anger on Froment. 'She
has heard that creature,' they said, 'and been bewitched
by him.' These ladies resolved that they
would see her no more.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_590" id="Ref_590" href="#Foot_590">[590]</a></span></p>

<p>Claudine did not despair of her friends. She continued
to live for God, and all might see that a holy
life, full of good works, proceeded from her faith.
The Genevan ladies, although unwilling to visit her,
watched her; and observing 'that she persevered in
well-doing, and was still a constant pattern of holy
living,' they drew near her. They were curious to
know the cause of this singular change, and began to
speak to her when they met her, some even going to
see her. Claudine received them affectionately, spoke
to them about that which filled her heart—this was
what her friends desired—presented them with the
New Testament, and begged them to read it and to
love the Saviour. Several of these ladies were converted,
especially those whom we have named. Claudine,
who was their 'exemplar of life and charity,'
pressed them to adopt a Christian conduct. 'Put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">{392}</a></span>
aside your great display,' she said to them, 'attire
yourselves simply and without superfluity, and give
your minds to great charities. Faith holds the
first place, but after that come good works.' From
that time indeed these women showed great compassion
for the wretched. The fame of their good deeds
spread abroad, and the Gospel was honoured by them.
It seemed admitted that no one could be a Christian
<i>unless he had some poor persecuted foreigner in his house</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_591" id="Ref_591" href="#Foot_591">[591]</a></span>
Such was the Christianity of Geneva at the
moment when it was beginning to appear, and such it
remained for two centuries.</p>

<p>Aimé Levet, who was at first strongly opposed to
Froment and the Gospel, gradually softened down.
The holiness and charity of his wife made him appreciate
the Word of God: 'thus Claudine won her
husband to the Lord.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_592" id="Ref_592" href="#Foot_592">[592]</a></span>
From that time she had
more liberty, and the meetings at the Croix
d'Or being insufficient, little assemblies were held
at her house or at others. When there was no
evangelist present capable of explaining the Bible,
they begged this pious christian woman to do it, saying:
'No one has received from the Lord greater gifts
than you.' Claudine would then read the scripture,
and set forth with simplicity the truths and graces
she had found therein. The reformers remembered
the precept of St. Paul, <i>Let your women keep silence
in the churches</i>; but they added, 'This must be
understood of the ordinary charge, for a case may
happen when it will be necessary for a woman to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">{393}</a></span>
speak in public.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_593" id="Ref_593" href="#Foot_593">[593]</a></span>
Ere long the modest Guérin, who
studied his Bible day and night, and other Christians
likewise, took an active part in the work of evangelisation.</p>

<p class="side">=CHURCH IN TRANSITION.=</p>

<p>The church was forming. At first there were a
few souls awakened separately here and there in
Geneva; now with the element of individuality, which
is the first, was combined the element of communion,
which is not less necessary, for Christianity is a leaven
that <i>leaveneth the whole lump</i>. Those who had begun
to believe assembled to advance together in faith.
Doubtless it was not yet a church in its complete
state, with all its institutions. Believers, even without
forming a church, may act upon one another,
pray in common, and celebrate the Lord's Supper
together; things ordinarily begin in this way. This
state of transition, the lawfulness of which must be
acknowledged, proves that the ecclesiastical organisation,
with its ministers, elders, deacons, presbyteries,
and synods, has not the first place in Christianity, and
that the pre-eminence belongs to faith and christian
sanctification. This imperfect mode of existence is
insufficient: it has many deficiencies, and is exposed
to many dangers. The church should be formed.
Somewhat later, under Calvin, it attained indeed its
complete form in Geneva. It would be foolish to
deny man the right of being at first a child; but it
would be no less so to refuse him the right and duty
of becoming a man.</p>

<p>Just at this time the evangelicals received an unexpected
help. A Franciscan coming from abroad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">{394}</a></span>
began to preach the Advent sermons in the Rive
church, and this monk, Christopher Bocquet by name,
happened to have some inclination for the Gospel.
Being invited to preach in a city where two parties
were at war, he abstained from both superstitions and
abuse—frequent themes with many catholic preachers—but
at the same time he abstained from certain
distinctive doctrines of the Reformation which he did
not quite understand, and keeping to a certain
common ground of Christianity, he delivered 'moderate' sermons.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_594" id="Ref_594" href="#Foot_594">[594]</a></span>
Dressed in his brown frock, and
with the cord round his waist, and humbly bending
his head, he entered the Cordeliers' church, went up
into the pulpit, and contemplating the mixed crowd
before him, proclaimed to all a Saviour who had come
not in magnificent array, but in gracious love, and
called upon every heart to rejoice at his sight. The
evangelicals were edified, and the number of persons
frequenting the church increased every day. But
Friar Christopher 'had hardly finished his sermon,'
when the huguenots hurried away to Froment's
meeting-place, where <i>the trumpet gave no uncertain
sound</i>. They were not the only persons who went
thither. Many catholics having heard the reformers
say that the monk and the schoolmaster preached
fundamentally the same things, followed the crowd
going to the Croix d'Or, and some of them took a
liking for what they heard.</p>

<p>Thus the people were more and more enlightened.
The evangelicals met sometimes at one house, sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">{395}</a></span>
at another; they read and discussed the little
tracts that were sent them, but above all applied themselves
to Holy Scripture. It was there only that
these simple Christians were willing to seek the light
which their consciences needed. 'Let us specially
study the sacred writings,' they said, 'in order that we
may distinguish in religion what comes from God,
from that which men have added to it.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_595" id="Ref_595" href="#Foot_595">[595]</a></span>
The Genevans retired from these meetings strengthened
and full of joy, and their love for the Word of God
continued to increase.</p>

<p>If the Reformation met with faithful adherents in
Geneva, it also encountered resolute adversaries. The
astonished and bewildered priests seemed to sleep.
Contenting themselves with a war of trifles, they made
no active and combined opposition to the evangelical
movement. It was the laity who uttered the cry
of alarm. Angry at the inactivity of the clergy,
they gave the signal of a 'holy war' destined in their
opinion to expel the infidels from their well-beloved
Zion. Thomas Moine<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_596" id="Ref_596" href="#Foot_596">[596]</a></span>
was at their head—a decided,
impetuous man, a fluent speaker, and one who had
attained great consideration in the Romish party; he
complained that they had permitted the enemy to
establish himself little by little in the ancient episcopal
city. He said that it was time to wake up, and
reproached the Genevese ecclesiastics for their cowardice.
Moine did not speak in vain.</p>

<p class="side">=SERMON AT THE MADELEINE.=</p>

<p>The vicar of La Madeleine touched by his words,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">{396}</a></span>
determined to exalt the honour of his church and
corporation, and gave notice that he would preach
against the heretical schoolmaster and the foreign
preacher. The large area was soon filled with fervent
catholics, among whom were some of the reformed, in
particular Chautemps, Claude Bernard, Salomon, and
Perrin. The vicar praised the catholic apostolic Roman
Church, extolled its head, who was (he said) the representative
of God, and defended its worship and
institutions. Then having praised the fold, he described
the 'wolves' that prowled around it to devour
the sheep. He accused Froment of ignorance and
falsehood, and conjured his hearers not to throw themselves
into the paws of wild beasts, thieves, and
robbers....</p>

<p>On leaving the church the four huguenots who had
heard him met to inquire what was to be done. These
men who at the first moment had, like the others,
given so bad a reception to the schoolmaster, had been
touched (three of them at least) by the simple preaching
of the Gospel. The Bible, as we have seen, had
become their court of appeal, which grieved the priests,
who dared not deny the divinity of the book, but as
they had never studied it, were much embarrassed to
find the proof of their dogmas in it. After some deliberation
Chautemps and his friends waited upon the
vicar. 'Froment,' they said, 'is a good and learned
man; you say that he has lied; prove it by Scripture?'
The vicar having consented, the huguenots demanded
that the discussion should take place in public, so that
all might profit by it; but the priest desired it to be
held at the parsonage. The champions of the Reformation
gave way, and arrangements were made for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">{397}</a></span>
disputation to take place on the last day of the year. The
poor priest (Claude Pelliez by name) was greatly embarrassed:
he retired to his room, took up the Vulgate,
which he did not often open, and began to look for
passages to oppose to the reformed doctrines; but he
searched in vain, he could find none.</p>

<p class="side">=A CONTROVERSY.=</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the 31st December, St. Sylvester's
day, Chautemps, Bernard, Perrin, and Salomon went to
the parsonage of the Madeleine, wearing their swords
as was customary. Some priests whom the curate
had invited were already there, but they had to wait
for the champion of Romanism who had not yet been
able to find a single text. The four huguenots took
off their belts, threw their swords on the bed, and
sitting round the table with the priests, began to talk
familiarly together. At last the vicar, who had had
some trouble to tear himself away from his folios, in
which he still hoped to find something, appeared with a
bulky volume under his arm. The huguenots rose
as he entered; beneath the table at which they
were sitting stood some wine-bottles which they and
the priests had emptied while waiting for him, and
which Perrin had paid for. The conference now
began. The vicar opened his big volume, in which
some strips of paper indicated the places he thought
favourable to him, and read a long extract opposed to
Froment's doctrine. 'What book is that,' asked
Perrin; 'it is not a Bible.' The huguenots added,
'You have not been able to find in the Bible one
word with which to answer Froment;' and laughed
at him. 'What is that you say,' retorted the priest,
reddening with anger; 'it is the <i>Postillæ perpetuæ in
Biblia</i> of the illustrious Nicholas Lyra!'—'But you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">{398}</a></span>
promised to refute Froment out of Scripture,'—Lyra,'
said the priest, 'is the most approved interpreter.'
The huguenots were determined not to accept the
commentaries of man as if they were the very Word
of God. The Bible incorruptible and infallible, before
which all human systems must fall, was the only
authority. 'Lyra is not a good doctor,' said Perrin.—'Yes!'—'No!'—'Yes!'—'You
do not keep your
word.' Perrin had understanding rather than real
piety: he was a lamp, but it had no oil. Haughty,
violent, and headstrong, he wanted everything to bend
before him, and so did the vicar. The quarrel grew
hot, and instead of discussing they abused each
other. Then one of the churchmen having left the
room stealthily, a band of priests suddenly entered
with one De la Roche at their head, who carried a
naked sword which he pointed in front of him.
'What!' said Claude Bernard, 'we came in good faith,
we four only, to your house to discuss; we have drunk
with your friends, we have thrown our swords on the
bed ... and you traitorously send for an armed
band of priests. It is a trap.' With these words the
four citizens grasped their swords, made a way through
their opponents, got out into the street, and held their
ground, ready to defend themselves. One of the
priests ran to the belfry of the Madeleine and began
to ring the tocsin.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_597" id="Ref_597" href="#Foot_597">[597]</a></span>
Thus ended the first theological dispute at Geneva.</p>

<p class="side">=TUMULT AT THE MADELEINE.=</p>

<p>It was about noon—a time favourable for a riot.
On hearing the church bell the city was thrown into
commotion, and everybody hurried to the spot. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">{399}</a></span>
was said that the huguenots desired to get possession
of the building so that the schoolmaster might preach
in it. Priests came forward with their adherents to
defend the sanctuary; huguenots took up arms to
protect their brethren hemmed in in front of the
church. 'Alas!' said the friends of peace, 'the priests
are ringing the tocsin, and thus exciting the citizens
to kill one another.' The four huguenots, with drawn
swords and their backs to the wall, prepared to give the
churchmen a warm reception; while their friends, as
they arrived, drew up by their side. The tumult was
general. 'Let us close in to the church,' said the
priests, who wished to surround it to prevent the
evangelicals from entering. Huguenots and catholics
hastened from every quarter to the Madeleine. Terror
seized the most timid. The poor ladies of St. Claire,
who were at dinner, hearing the noise, rose from the
table in alarm, and exclaiming, 'Alas! they have
threatened to marry us ... they are going to put
their abominable plot into execution,' made a procession
round their church and garden with great
devotion and many tears.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_598" id="Ref_598" href="#Foot_598">[598]</a></span></p>

<p>Just at this time the council broke up, and two of
the syndics, Ramel and Savoie, who were going home,
had to pass through the midst of the riot. The two
parties were on the point of coming to blows. The
syndics advanced, checked the combatants by interposing
their official staves, and ordered them to lay
down their arms, which was done. 'There was neither
violence nor bloodshed.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_599" id="Ref_599" href="#Foot_599">[599]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">{400}</a></div>

<p>But all was not ended. Some members of the
chapter and several priests, hearing that a fight was
going on at the Madeleine, had collected in the
Rue des Chanoines, where William Canal, incumbent
of St. Germain's, harangued them. The catholic faith
is threatened, the throne of the pope is shaken, the
great honour due to Mary is endangered.... We
must fall upon those who impugn it, and free the city
from their persons and their errors. Such was the
sum of his discourse.</p>

<p>The tumult being quieted round the church,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_600" id="Ref_600" href="#Foot_600">[600]</a></span>
the lieutenant of justice (Châteauneuf) had turned towards
the Rue des Chanoines, where he had been told that
the priests were in commotion. Finding them determined
to follow Canal sword in hand to the Madeleine,
he commanded them to stop. The priest
of St. Germain's, unwilling to submit to the orders
of a civil magistrate, rushed hastily towards the
church. Châteauneuf laid his hand upon him, when
the rebellious parson turned round and levelled his
arquebuse at that officer; but a friendly arm prevented
his firing. Canal ran off, and the other
priests dispersed.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_601" id="Ref_601" href="#Foot_601">[601]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=FROMENT DESIRED NOT TO PREACH.=</p>

<p>The council reassembled in the evening. Each
opinion was represented in that body, which halted between
two opinions. After a riot like that which had
just occurred, it was necessary to take certain precautions,
especially as the morrow was New Year's day, and
at such times men's minds are more easily excited. The
council summoned the principal friends of the reform,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">{401}</a></span>
and Froment also was invited, although the Registers
make no mention of his presence. 'We exhort you,'
said the syndics, 'to make Anthony Froment cease from
disputing and preaching, as well as the others who
teach in private houses; and we conjure you to live as
your fathers did.' No one would make any promise;
on the contrary, the reformed withdrew, saying, 'We
will hear the Word of God wherever we can: nobody
has a right to hide it.' Then turning to Froment,
they begged him not to be silent under such prohibition.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_602" id="Ref_602" href="#Foot_602">[602]</a></span>
'We are constrained,' they said, 'to hear the
schoolmaster and his friends, because the decree of the
council ordering the Word of God to be preached in
every parish has not been observed.' The reformed,
while desiring before all things to obey God, put
themselves in the right: they appealed to lawful ordinances,
and this was the ground which they intended
keeping.</p>

<p>The council, acknowledging that this position of the
evangelicals was impregnable, sent for the Abbot of
Bonmont, the vicar-episcopal, and begged him to detain
at Geneva the cordelier who had preached the Advent
so well, and to press the Dominicans also to provide a
preacher calculated to edify their congregation. They
required further that there should be true preachers
of the Word of God in every parish. The vicar-episcopal,
being a peaceful man, promised everything, even
to punishing Canal the priest.</p>

<p>The tumult was appeased, but great agitation still
reigned in men's minds. Some saw that the storm
was over, others that it might easily break out again.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">{402}</a></span>
As it was St. Sylvester's eve, there were numerous
meetings throughout the city, catholics and huguenots
being equally excited, and both waiting anxiously for
the morrow.<span

 <h3>CHAPTER XII.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">THE SERMON AT THE MOLARD.<br />
 (<span class="smc">New Year's Day, 1533.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOR nearly twenty years liberty had been clearing
the ground on which the Gospel was to raise its
temple. For nearly eight years a few pious voices
had spoken of the doctrine of salvation in private
conversations and meetings; but the Reformation had
not yet been preached in the face of the people. The
hour that was to make it a public and notorious thing
was about to strike; the world was about to witness
the birth of the principles of that moral power which
for two centuries, whatever may have been the meanness
of its origin, has influenced the destinies of
christendom; which, fanning the flame, that is to say,
inspiring the friends of the Reformation with heavenly
courage, has waged heroic battles against the Jesuits
and the inquisition, and preserved the Gospel and
liberty from dangerous assaults. Geneva was about
to hear the voice of a protestant.</p>

<p class="side">=A NEW YEAR.=</p>

<p>The last night of the year 1532 had passed away,
and first of 1533 was beginning. In every house
relations and friends were greeting the new year,
which the reformed hoped would be better than all
that had gone before. The family congratulations
being over, they went to church. Bocquet was again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">{404}</a></span>
preaching at the Gray Friar's monastery, where many
evangelicals attended; but the monk had hardly
finished, when numbers of his hearers quitted the
chapel and hurried eagerly along the Rue de Rive to
the Croix d'Or. There were many curious persons
among them, who, knowing that the council had prohibited
Froment's preaching, were all the more desirous
of hearing him. In a moment the hall was filled, then
the stairs and passage ... and at last the street
in front of the house. Froment arrived with a few
friends, and seeing the crowd, observed: 'The streets
are so full, that it is quite a crush.' He tried however
to make his way through the mass, and his
friends assisted him; but do what he would, all his
exertions were ineffectual.</p>

<p>Was all this unforeseen, or was it premeditated by
some of the huguenots? Were these energetic men
determined at last to bring the evangelist from his
narrow schoolroom and force him to preach in public?
Is there not some truth in Sister Jeanne's statement
that, on the evening before, they had desired to make
him preach in the large area of the Madeleine? And
may we not believe, that as they did not succeed then,
they now desired to compensate themselves by taking
a still larger space and making the reformer preach
in the open air? These suppositions appear probable,
but there is no decided evidence in their favour. At
all events, the crowd recognized Froment, and saw
that he could not reach the usual place of his ministrations.
Those who were in the street perceived that if
the evangelist succeeded in entering the Croix d'Or,
they would be left outside, which was not agreeable to
them. One man shouted out: 'To the Molard,' and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">{405}</a></span>
in a short time the cry became general: 'To the
Molard, to the Molard.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_604" id="Ref_604" href="#Foot_604">[604]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=FROMENT AT THE MOLARD.=</p>

<p>The Molard was situated in the most populous
quarter of the city, near the lake and the Rhone. It
was a large square, about 200 yards from the Croix
d'Or. Froment hesitated, but the crowd, getting
into motion, carried him along with them towards
the south-west corner of the square, where the fish
market is still held. The fishwomen were there with
their fresh wares displayed on their stalls. The
huguenots, finding no other pulpit, took one of these
stalls, and invited Froment to get on it. He was
determined, like his master Farel, to preach the truth
in every place.</p>

<p>As soon as his head appeared above the others, the
multitude that filled the square manifested their
delight, and those around him shouted louder than
ever: 'Preach to us, preach the Word of God to us.'
Froment, who was moved, answered with a loud voice:
'It is also the word that shall endure for ever.' The
tumult was so great that the preacher could not make
himself heard: 'He made a sign to them with his
hand to keep silence, and they were still.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_605" id="Ref_605" href="#Foot_605">[605]</a></span>
'Pray to God with me,' he said, and then getting off the stall,
he knelt upon the ground. He was agitated: the
tears flowed down his cheeks;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_606" id="Ref_606" href="#Foot_606">[606]</a></span>
a deep silence prevailed
in that square which was so often in those days
the scene of tumultuous movements. Some knelt,
others remained standing; all heads were uncovered,
and even those who were strangers to the Gospel,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">{406}</a></span>
appeared thoughtful. Froment joined his hands, lifted
his eyes to heaven, and speaking so distinctly that all
could hear him, he said:<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_607" id="Ref_607" href="#Foot_607">[607]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=PRAYER AT THE MOLARD.=</p>

<p>'Eternal God, father of all mercies, thou hast promised
thy children to give them whatsoever they shall
ask in faith, and wilt refuse them nothing that is reasonable
and just; and hast always heard the prayers of thy
servants, who are oppressed in divers manners. Thou
knowest now what is the need of this people better
than they or I do.... This need is principally to hear
thy Word. It is true we have been ungrateful in not
acknowledging thee as our only Father, and thine
own son Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent to die for
us, in order to be our only Saviour and intercessor.
But, Lord, thou hast promised us that whensoever the
poor sinner draws near thee, by reason of thy Son,
born of the Virgin Mary, thou wilt hear him. We
know and even are assured that thou desirest not the
death and destruction of sinners, but that they should
be converted and live.... Thou desirest that they
should not remain under the great tyranny of Antichrist,
and under the hand of the devil and his servants,
who are continually fighting against thy holy
Word and destroying thy work.... Our Father! look
down upon thy poor blind people, led by the blind, so
that they both fall into the ditch, and can only be
lifted out by thy mercy.... Lift them out by thy Holy
Spirit, open their eyes, their ears, their understandings,
their hearts, in order that, confessing their sins,
they may look to the goodness of thy Son whom thou
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">{407}</a></span>
hast given to die for them. And since it hath pleased
thee, Lord, to send me to them, give both them and
me the infinite grace that by thy Holy Spirit they
may receive what thou shalt put into the mouth of
thy servant, who is unworthy to be the bearer of so
great a message. But as it hath pleased thee to
choose me from among the weak things of the world,
give me strength and wisdom so that thy power may
be manifested ... not only in this city but in all the
world. How can thy servant stand in the presence
of such a multitude of adversaries, unless thou art
pleased to strengthen him? Show, then, that thy
power is greater than Satan's, and that thy strength
is not like man's strength.' Froment concluded with
the Lord's prayer.</p>

<p class="side">=SERMON AT THE MOLARD.=</p>

<p>The people were touched: they had often heard
the mechanical prayers of the priests, but not a prayer
of the heart. They acknowledged that the reformers
were certainly not partisans, but Christians who desired
the salvation of all men. The evangelist rose
and stood once more upon the stall, which was
about to become the first pulpit of the Reformation
in Geneva. He had heard of the proceedings of the
vicars of the Madeleine and St. Germain's, and was
moved by the furious opposition of the priests to the
preaching of the Gospel. He had their swords and
arquebuses still before his eyes, and resolved to
oppose them with the sword of the Spirit, which is
the Word of God. It was necessary to lead the
Genevans away from the teachers who deceived them
and direct them to Scripture; it was necessary to
break with the papacy. All eyes were fixed on him:
they saw him take a book—it was the Gospel. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">{408}</a></span>
opened it at the seventh chapter of Matthew and read
these words: <i>Beware of false prophets, which come
to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are
ravening wolves: by their fruits ye shall know them</i>.
Then fixing his eyes on his numerous audience,
Froment began by expressing his faith in the mysteries
of God: 'Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
very God and very Man, conceived of the Holy Ghost
and born of the Virgin Mary, knowing the things
that were to happen, foresaw that false prophets
would come, not with hideous faces, but with the
most pleasing exterior in the world, under the colour
of holiness, and in <i>sheep's clothing</i>, so that the children
of God might be deceived. For this cause he exhorted
his disciples to be <i>wise as serpents and harmless
as doves</i>. Our God does not desire to have a foolish,
giddy people, but a people endowed with great wisdom,
who can distinguish between the doctrine of
God and the doctrine of man. They who do not
know it go astray, and are like swine which cannot
discern good things from bad, and swallow everything
indiscriminately.... Ah! if the serpent, which is
but a brute, is so wise in his generation, if he shuts
his ears so as not to hear the voice of the charmer,
if he casts off his old skin when the time for doing so
has come, shall we not fear to follow the cunningly-devised
doctrines of men? Shall we not cast off our
old skin to put on a new one? Yes, we must put off
our old nature which is sin, Satan, idolatry, impurity,
robbery, hypocrisy, pride, avarice, and false doctrine,
and put on the new man, which is Christ.... It
would be of no use to hear the Word of the Gospel if
we did not change our wicked intentions, and to distinguish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">{409}</a></span>
the false teachers if we did not avoid them.
What! if we recognized venomous beasts should we
live among them? If we saw a dish of poison should
we not beware of eating it?</p>

<p>'But Christ desires us further to be <i>harmless as
doves</i>. Not with the simplicity of monastic hypocrisy
or bigotry, but with simplicity of heart, without gall,
lovely as that of doves.... If we walk in such simplicity
we shall overcome all our enemies, as Jesus
Christ overcame his enemies by his meekness....
Let us not begin fighting, killing, and burning as
tyrants do. The child of God has no other sword of
defence than the Word of God; but that is a two-edged
sword, piercing even to the marrow.'</p>

<p>Everybody understood Froment's allusion, and
many, as they thought of the riot of the evening
before, looked and smiled at each other. But while
these words, delivered with energy, were stirring the
crowd assembled in the Molard, there was still greater
agitation in the rest of the city. The priests were
irritated; they had tried to shut Froment's schoolroom,
and now he was preaching in the great square.
They went from one to another and excited the laity.
'The Lutherans,' they said, 'have taken their <i>idol</i> to
the Molard to make him preach there.' The vicar-episcopal
being instructed by them, apprised the
syndics, who sent for the chief usher (<i>grand sautier</i>)
Falquet, and ordered him to stop the preaching.
That officer immediately went down to the Molard,
the sergeants cleared a way through the crowd, and
going up to Froment, who was then speaking with
great boldness, he stretched out his staff towards him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">{410}</a></span>
and said, 'In the name of my lords I command you
to cease preaching.'</p>

<p>Froment stopped, and turning to the chief usher
answered him in a loud voice, '<i>We ought to obey God
rather than man</i>. God commands me to preach His
word, you forbid it; I am therefore not bound to
obey you.' The presence of the public force caused,
however, some little sensation in the audience. The
evangelist noticing it turned to the people and said,
'Do not be disturbed, my friends, but listen to what
our Lord says—that we must beware of false prophets.'
Silence was restored, everyone became calm, and Falquet,
finding the evangelist was determined to preach,
thought it the safest plan to refer to his masters,
and withdrew with his officers. Froment then continued
his discourse: 'In order to be on our guard
against false prophets, we must know what they are,
what is their doctrine and life, and with what they
are clothed. When they have been described to you
in their natural colours, you will avoid their teaching
and their life as more deadly than the plague. The
plagues with which God has visited you heretofore<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_608" id="Ref_608" href="#Foot_608">[608]</a></span>
only touched you outwardly; but this, more venomous
than all the other poisons of the earth, infects the soul,
kills it, and casts it into perdition. With this plague
we and our fathers have been infected for nearly a
thousand years. Not that it came upon us suddenly,
and in villanous and deformed appearance; no, it
came gradually, under the colour of holiness and in
sheep's clothing, these ravening wolves having even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">{411}</a></span>
some good intentions. But although Jesus Christ had
warned us of their coming, and had pointed them out
to us, we have been blinded and led by the nose to
the ditch of deceit like cattle to water.... The son
of perdition, who sitting in the temple of God is
worshipped as God—him you worship and keep his
commandments. Oh! what a fine master you serve,
and what prophets you have! Do you know them?
Not to keep you in suspense I declare openly that I
am speaking of the pope, and that the false prophets
of whom I bid you beware are the priests, monks, and
all the rest of his train.</p>

<p>'But some of you, who yourselves belong to that
band, will say: "It is you that are the false prophets!
Our law is old, and yours is but of yesterday, and brings
confusion among the people of every country. While
our friends reigned, we enjoyed so much good, so many
happy years, that it was quite marvellous; but since
you have come to preach this new law there have
been wars, famines, pestilences, divisions, strifes, and
ill-will. Certainly you are not from God."</p>

<p>'Well, let us examine this statement; let us find out
who are these false prophets—we or your priests?...
In order to discriminate in such a matter the
two parties ought to have a competent judge, who is
no acceptor of persons, and that the parties should not
be judges in their own cause. For if, in civil causes,
we need good judges, good pleadings, good witnesses,
good reasons, and letters patent, how much more so in
the things of God!... We shall take, therefore, a competent
judge, and shall produce witnesses, documents,
and ancient customs for the defence of our right.'</p>

<p>Curiosity was excited; the hearers asked each other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">{412}</a></span>
what was the judge's name. Hitherto the pope had
been appealed to as sole judge of controversies: who
was Froment going to put in his place?</p>

<p>'In the first place,' he continued, 'the judge shall be—God.
Yes, God who judges with righteous judgment,
not regarding either rich or poor, wise or foolish,
and who gives right to whom it belongs;—the judge
shall be His true Son Jesus Christ, attended by His
good and lawful witnesses the prophets and apostles;
and here,' said he, holding up the New Testament,
and showing it to the people, 'here are the sealed
letters, signed with the precious blood of our Lord,
and the cloud of martyrs who were put to death in
order to bear this testimony. What read we there?</p>

<p>'Firstly, the Lord condemns the Pharisees as <i>blind
leaders</i>. Now, do you not think that yours (the
Romish priests) are condemned by him?... Those
who call themselves saints through their own merits,
the only saints of the church, and who wish to lead
you by their bulls, pardons, auricular confessions,
masses, and other tricks or manœuvres which they
have invented out of their own heads ... which the
Pharisees never dared do.</p>

<p>'Moreover, the Lord in St. Matthew bears this testimony:
There shall arise false prophets in the latter
days who will say unto you, <i>Lo, here is Christ or there</i>!<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_609" id="Ref_609" href="#Foot_609">[609]</a></span>
Do they not tell you that Christ is there ... in the
inner part of the holy house, hidden in the farthest
place, <i>in a vessel</i>? Do not believe them. The true
Christ is he who hath ransomed us with his blood.
Seek him by a real faith at the right hand of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">{413}</a></span>
Father, and not in a house, in a cupboard, in the pyx
... as your new redeemers and high-priests do.</p>

<p>'And what says Jesus Christ to-day for the fuller
identification of the false prophets? He not only says
that they come in sheep's clothing, but that <i>they walk
in long robes, devour widows' houses, and for a show
make long prayers</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_610" id="Ref_610" href="#Foot_610">[610]</a></span>
The Lord does not forbid wearing
long robes for the necessities of the body, but the
hypocritical superstitions connected with them, the
wearers esteeming themselves holier than the laity,
by being dressed, shaven, and shorn differently from
us.... Yes, by such means they have devoured
widows; I do not mean to say that they eat women;
it is a manner of speaking, as we say of tyrants that
they devour their people, and of lawyers that they
devour their clients, that is to say, their substance;
and not that they eat men's flesh, as the cannibals
do. <i>They break their bones</i> (to get at the marrow),
says a prophet, <i>and eat the flesh of my people, as
flesh within the caldron</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_611" id="Ref_611" href="#Foot_611">[611]</a></span></p>

<p>'Look now, O people, I pray you, and judge for
yourselves. Tell us who are those who wear such
clothing, such <i>long robes</i>, who <i>devour widows</i>, making
long prayers for show.... You know very well it
is not us, for we are dressed like other people; but
if your priests were to dress like us they would be
apostate and excommunicate.</p>

<p>'Nay more, we do not lead poor people to understand
that they ought to bring us a portion of their
goods, and that then we will save them; that praying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">{414}</a></span>
for them and the dead, we will bring them out of purgatory....
But your priests do so, and under such
pretexts they have dragged into their paws almost all
the riches of the earth; and not a word must be said
about it ... for whosoever speaks of it will suddenly
be put to death, or be excommunicated, or called
heretic and Lutheran.</p>

<p>'Ah! Jesus Christ, St. Paul, and the other apostles
paint them so truly to the life that there is no one so
blind or stupid as not to recognise them easily, except
those who are afraid of losing their soup-tickets. The
Holy Scriptures call them wells without water, anti-christs,
despisers of the Lord, and say that they <i>give
heed to doctrines of devils, forbidding to marry, and
commanding to abstain from meats which God hath
created to be received with thankfulness of them which
believe</i>.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_612" id="Ref_612" href="#Foot_612">[612]</a></span></p>

<p>While Froment was thus haranguing the people in
the Molard, the magistrates assembled in the hotel-de-ville
learnt from the chief usher that the sermon was
still going on. The syndics were exasperated. The
canons and priests argued that as the civil power was
helpless, they ought to take the matter into their own
hands, and, grasping their arms, prepared to descend.
At the same time, the council being resolved to make
an example, ordered the preachers to be apprehended
wherever they were found; and consequently the
lieutenant of police, the procurator-fiscal, with sergeants,
soldiers, and priests, marched in a large body
to the Molard, angry and indignant at the evangelist's
boldness, and determined to throw him into prison.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">{415}</a></span>
If Farel had been placed beyond their reach, Froment
at least should not escape. While this excited band
was descending the Perron with deadly intentions,
Froment, who either had no suspicion, or did not care
about it, was continuing his discourse to the people
of Geneva.</p>

<p>'There are many other passages of scripture,' he
said, 'which might be brought forward for a stronger
proof; but these must suffice to put you in a position
to judge whether we or your pastors are false prophets.
There is none among you who does not know that we
do not forbid marriage or meats; that we declare marriage
holy, ordained from the beginning of the world
to all such as have not the gift of continence, without
any distinction of persons. But the pope does otherwise,
and says that he who hath not a lawful wife may
keep a concubine (<i>Distinctio</i> xxxiv. cap. xvi. <i>Qui non
habet uxorem, loco illius concubinam habere potest</i>);
for, he adds, I desire that they be holy.... Verily a
wonderful holiness is that!... I make you all judges.
You have long known them better than I have.</p>

<p>'As for meats, we leave every man free, as our Lord
has done, exhorting the people to use them profitably,
without excess or superfluity, giving thanks to God....
But these do the very opposite. Although Christ was
sent by the Father to teach us the truth, they bring
us lies, dreams, false doctrines, prohibitions of marriage
and of meats, and all sorts of nonsense, as if they
were holy things.'...</p>

<p class="side">=THE SERMON INTERRUPTED.=</p>

<p>At this moment a confused noise was heard. Claude
Bernard, whose eyes and ears were on the watch,
perceived a band of armed men entering the square.
The lieutenant of the city, the procurator-fiscal, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">{416}</a></span>
soldiers and the armed priests, exasperated and impatient,
were occupying the Molard. Bernard saw
that resistance would be dangerous and useless; besides
the Reformation must not be established in
Geneva by violence, it must make its way by conviction.
There was not a moment to be lost; every one
knew what would be the fate of the evangelist if he
were taken.... He must be saved. Bernard therefore
sprang from his place and rushed 'in great excitement'
towards Froment, shouting to him at the
top of his voice:<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_613" id="Ref_613" href="#Foot_613">[613]</a></span>
'Here are all the priests in
arms ... the procurator-fiscal and the lieutenant of
the city are with them.... For the honour of God
descend, get off the stall, and let us save your life!...
Make your escape!' Froment would not come down:
they entreated him in vain; his heart burnt within
him, for he perceived that his discourse was stirring
their souls.... How could he forsake his work at
such a decisive moment? But the priests and arquebusiers
were coming nearer; Some of the huguenots
were already grasping their swords and preparing to
resist the sacerdotal gang. There would have been
bloodshed and death. 'Pray, for God's honour, let
us avoid the spilling of blood,' exclaimed Bernard.
Froment could not resist these words. Some of his
friends caught hold of him, lifted him off the stall
and dragged him away. They took him through a
narrow private passage, and by this means reached
Jean Chautemps' house. The door opened and the
evangelist was put into a secret hiding-place. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">{417}</a></span>
priests and soldiers vainly endeavoured to reach him;
the mass of hearers was between them and him. The
lieutenant ordered the people 'under heavy penalties'
to retire; and when the preacher was in safety, the
assembly dispersed. The magistrates and priests
returned angry and disappointed to report this second
failure to the syndics. The Word had not been sown
in vain; many of the hearers found that they had
received a glorious new year's gift. Such was the
first day of the year 1533 at Geneva.</p>

<p class="side">=FROMENT IN HIDING.=</p>

<p>All the priests and their followers had not returned
to the hotel de ville. Froment had disappeared, but
he could not be far off. Some of them prowled about
the adjacent streets, trying to discover the reformer's
hiding place. At last one of them found it out.
Chautemps was known to be a decided evangelist, and
they called to mind that Olivetan had lived in his house.
Several catholics stationed themselves under his windows,
and when the night came, they began to make
an uproar. This alarmed Froment's friends; and
going to his hiding place they told him that 'he must
move to the house of another citizen.' They went out
by a back-door, and, owing to the darkness, he was
conducted without being recognised to the house of
the energetic Perrin, who was more dreaded than the
honest Chautemps. Ere long, however, the priests and
their adherents followed him there: 'Ami Perrin,'
they shouted, 'we will pull down your house and burn
you in it if you do not send the Lutheran away.'
Perrin made use of stratagem: going out to the
riotous catholics, he said: 'We have liberty to keep
an honest servant in our houses without impediment
from anybody.' He then said to Froment: 'You are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">{418}</a></span>
my servant, I engage you as such, and you shall work
for me.' At the same time a few of Perrin's friends,
stanch huguenots, came up the street, presenting
such a threatening front to the priests, that they were
forced to retire. The syndics determined to convoke
the great council on the morrow.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_614" id="Ref_614" href="#Foot_614">[614]</a></span></p>

<p>The circumstances were serious: the new doctrine
had been preached publicly, and Froment's bold address
had made an impression, especially on the huguenots.
They had discovered that the surest means of guaranteeing
their political emancipation was to establish a
religious reformation. At the Molard, liberty and
the Gospel had shaken hands. The catholics asked
whether the pope's sovereignty was about to fall
to the ground. The various parties grew warm,
abused each other, and lively discussions took place
between them. The politicians maintained that if the
city was divided on such all-important matters, their
irreconcileable enemy Savoy would plant his white
cross on the walls he had coveted so long. Certain
laymen, full of confidence in their own ability, doubted
whether strangers and madmen (<i>follateurs</i>) should be
permitted to vent their nonsense everywhere?... The
priests spoke the loudest: they asked the Genevans if
they would forsake the faith of their ancestors; if the
catholic and apostolic religion, attacked, overthrown,
and annihilated, was to give place to a new doctrine
that would bring down the ruin of Geneva. The
huguenots replied that if the religion announced by
the reformers was not that of the pope, the schoolmen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">{419}</a></span>
the councils, and perhaps even of the Fathers, it was
at least that of the apostles and Jesus Christ, and consequently
was older than that of Rome. They represented
that as the papal government was nothing else
than despotism in the church, it could produce nothing
but despotism in the state. The two parties became
more distinct every day. The syndics and councillors,
wishing to restore concord, went from one to another,
trying to calm down the more violent; but it was a
very hard task.</p>

<p class="side">=THE COUNCIL MEETS.=</p>

<p>On the 2nd of January, when the council of Two
Hundred met, the premier syndic proposed, 'that it
should be forbidden to preach in private houses or in
public places without the permission of the syndics or
the vicar-episcopal,—and that all who knew of
preachers guilty of infringing this law should be
bound to inform against them, under penalty of <i>three
stripes with the rope</i>.' At these words the huguenots
exclaimed, 'We demand the Holy Scriptures;' to
which the friends of the priests replied, 'We desire
that sect to be utterly extirpated.' The council
thought to restore harmony between everybody by
carrying a resolution that Bocquet the gray friar
should preach until next Lent.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_615" id="Ref_615" href="#Foot_615">[615]</a></span></p>

<p>The premier syndic, who was distressed at the strife
and hatred by which the citizens were divided, proposed
that 'all men, citizens, and inhabitants, should
forgive one another.' The Genevans, who were prompt
to anger, were equally prompt to reconciliation. 'Yes,
yes,' they exclaimed, as they lifted up their hands, 'We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">{420}</a></span>
desire to love those who are of a contrary opinion.'
And soon bands of men might be seen parading the
streets, in which persons of the most opposite opinions
held one another affectionately by the arm.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_616" id="Ref_616" href="#Foot_616">[616]</a></span></p>

<p>Meantime Froment remained in Perrin's house and
wove ribbons, 'otherwise he could not have stayed
there,' as he informs us. Whilst seated in silence at
the loom, passing the shuttle to and fro, he deliberated
whether he should remain in hiding or again openly
proclaim the Gospel? Having made up his mind to
go from house to house to strengthen those who had
believed, he went out and knocked at certain doors; a
few of his friends, armed with stout sticks, followed
him at a distance, without his knowledge, to prevent
his being insulted. One day, however, a vulgar
woman abusing him roundly, Jean Favre, a violent
huguenot, and his body-guard, went up and gave her
'a sound slap on the face.' Froment turned round,
distressed at his friend's hastiness: 'It is not by violence,'
said he, 'that we shall gain friends, but by
gentleness and friendship.'</p>

<p class="side">=ATTACK ON FROMENT.=</p>

<p>Another time Froment was crossing the Rhone
bridge to go to Aimé Levet's.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_617" id="Ref_617" href="#Foot_617">[617]</a></span>
It was a holiday, and
the priests at the head of a procession were advancing
on one end of the bridge as Froment arrived at the
other. They were carrying crosses and relics, mumbling
prayers and invoking the saints: <i>Sancte Petre</i>,
chanted some; <i>Sancte Paule</i>, chanted others. Froment,
being taken by surprise and embarrassed, determined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">{421}</a></span>
to be moderate, and not to throw the saints into the
river as Farel had done at Montbeliard. He therefore
stood still, but did not bow to the images. When
they saw this, the priests left off chanting and began
to shout: 'Fall on him!... fall on the dog!... to the
Rhone with him!' The devout women who followed
them, breaking their ranks, rushed upon the reformer;
one caught him by the arm, another by the dress,
while a third pushed him from behind: 'To the
Rhone' with him they cried, and endeavoured to throw
him into the river. But his body-guard, consisting
of John Humbert and some other huguenots, who
were a little way off, ran up and rescued Froment
from the hands of these furies. Upon this the women,
priests, and sacristans, seeing that the Lutherans had
saved their <i>idol</i>, shouted still louder than before. A
tumultuous crowd filled the bridge. The huguenots,
wishing to put Froment in a place of safety, hurriedly
thrust him into Levet's house, which was situated at
the corner of the bridge.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_618" id="Ref_618" href="#Foot_618">[618]</a></span>
The populace, excited by
the clergy, instantly besieged the house: they flung
stones at the windows, threw mud into the shop, and
at last rushed in and scattered the drugs and bottles
upon the floor. Levet was an apothecary—a profession
much esteemed. The huguenots, having put
Froment in safety in a secret chamber, went out and
assisted by a few friends drove the priests, women,
and rioters from the bridge.</p>

<p>At night Froment left his hiding-place and returned
to Perrin's, where he assembled a few friends and told
them that he thought it was his duty to leave the city
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">{422}</a></span>
on account of these 'raging tempests.' Chautemps,
Perrin, Levet, and Guerin were much distressed, but
they confessed that the violence of his enemies
rendered the evangelist's longer stay in Geneva useless.
Claude Magnin offered to accompany him, and
when the night came Froment bade his brethren farewell.
Proceeding cautiously, he quitted the city,
crossed the Pays de Vaud, and arrived at the village of
Yvonand, where he rested from his Genevese battles.</p>

<p>Froment was not one of those eminent men who play
a part because of their great character, and whose influence
is continually on the increase. His ministry
at Geneva during part of the winter 1532-33 was the
heroic period of his life, after which he seldom
appears but in the second or third rank: he was
eclipsed by teachers who were superior to him. In
the briefness of his ministry he resembles those
heavenly bodies which attract all eyes for a few
weeks, and then disappear; but he resembles them
also by the influence which the people ascribe to their
ephemeral passage. Froment's stay in Geneva shook
the Romish traditions, secured the Holy Scriptures
from oblivion, began to shed a few rays of light in the
city, and laid the first foundations of the Church.
Ere long the Word of God was carried thither in greater
fulness by Farel and Calvin: the sun poured out all
its light, and a solid majestic edifice was built on the
foundations laid by the poor schoolmaster.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">HOLY SCRIPTURE AND THE LORD'S SUPPER AT GENEVA.<br />
 (<span class="smc">January and February 1533.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="side">=THIRST FOR THE GOSPEL.=</p>

<p class="drop-cap">FROMENT'S departure did but increase the love of
the Gospel in serious minds. Deprived of what
they considered their right—hearing the Gospel
preached—they suffered from the want, and were
determined to free themselves from the spiritual destitution
to which they were reduced by the clerical
system. Others felt no less decided aspirations for
liberty, and were unwittingly the instruments of a
greater revolution than they had imagined. These Genevans
felt, as if by inspiration, that at the beginning of
the sixteenth century society was passing through a
crisis, and that a new phase was opening for mankind.
They did more than observe it: they were personally
the chief actors in the revolution that was about to
be accomplished in the world. Leaving the barren
nations in their lifeless stagnation, the men of this
little city shouted 'Forward!' and rushed into the
arena.</p>

<p>Froment had hardly left Geneva before the partisans
of the reformation raised their heads. The Romish
Church had on its side the bishop-prince, the clergy,
the Friburgers, and even the majority of the council
and people; but if the friends of reform were in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">{424}</a></span>
minority as regards material force, they surpassed their
adversaries in moral strength. The historian asserts
that from this moment the two parties were nearly
equal in power.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_619" id="Ref_619" href="#Foot_619">[619]</a></span>
The grey friar Bocquet, who 'had
managed with so much address,' says a manuscript,
'that both parties went to hear him with equal eagerness,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_620" id="Ref_620" href="#Foot_620">[620]</a></span>
now began to preach the christian truth more
openly. The astonished priests were still more exasperated
against the monk than they had been against
the reformer, and solicited that he should be silenced.</p>

<p>The hands of the clergy were ere long strengthened
by a powerful ally. On February 23, six Friburg
councillors, stanch catholics, entered Geneva, the
bearers of a threatening letter. 'If you wish to become
Lutherans,' said they to the council, 'Friburg
renounces your alliance.' The syndics answered to
no purpose that they desired to live as their forefathers
had done: the Friburgers made a great disturbance
about the grey friar's sermons, and the council decided,
'for the love of peace,' that Bocquet should leave
Geneva.</p>

<p class="side">=BAUDICHON DE LA MAISONNEUVE.=</p>

<p>The friends of the Gospel, seeing that even the
Franciscan was taken from them, did not lose heart.
The Holy Scriptures remained: they read in their
homes Lefèvre's New Testament, and formed meetings
at which the Word of God was explained. The
assemblies 'which took place in the houses here and
there were multiplied,' and the number of believers
increased every day.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_621" id="Ref_621" href="#Foot_621">[621]</a></span>
They met ordinarily at the
end of the Rue des Allemands, at the house of Baudichon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">{425}</a></span>
de la Maisonneuve, who henceforward became a
most zealous protestant. Sprung from a noble and
powerful family in the republic, he had a decided character
and some talent, and carried to extremes his
convictions and his desire to make them succeed.
Individual life had prevailed during the feudal times;
in the sixteenth century the social element was growing
stronger every day. There were, however, certain
natures which still maintained their independent individualism,
and Baudichon was one of them. Accordingly,
so long as it was only a question of destroying
the old order of things, he acquitted himself valiantly;
but he was less useful, when it was necessary to build
up the new order. He seems, however, to have been
aware of his own insufficiency. His arms were a
house (<i>maison</i>), and above the crest an open hand
with these words: <i>Except the Lord build the house,
they labour in vain that build it</i>.</p>

<p>The Lord did build: assemblies were formed, and
Baudichon's house became the <i>catacombs</i> (says an old
author) in which the new Christians held their humble meetings.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_622" id="Ref_622" href="#Foot_622">[622]</a></span>
They arrived, saluted each other fraternally,
sat down in a large room, and remained a few
moments in silence. They knew that though they
were many, they had all one sole Mediator, present
in the midst of them although unseen. Then one of
them would read a portion of Scripture, another of
the better informed explained and applied it, and a
third prayed.... The believers departed edified
from their meetings, 'which were so different (they
said) from the pope's mass.'</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">{426}</a></div>

<p>Sometimes a great treat was granted them. Some
evangelical foreigner passed through Geneva; the
news spread immediately to every family; the
place and time were named when he would preach,
and the believers flocked thither from every quarter.
'What is his name?' they asked one day. 'Peter
Maneri.' 'What is he?' 'A minister.' 'Where is
he staying?' 'At Claude Pasta's.' And Claude
Pasta's rooms were filled immediately.</p>

<p>These first evangelicals of Geneva were not content
merely with being taught sound doctrine; they knew
that a cold knowledge of God can save no man, and
that it is necessary to live with the Spirit of Christ,
and as He lived. They had formed a fund among
themselves, and Salomon was the treasurer. Every
one brought his mite for the relief of the poor,
whether Genevans or foreigners. Thus these christians
learnt at once to believe, to love, and to give.</p>

<p>Two kinds of protestantism were already beginning,
however, to appear in Geneva, which have not
ceased and perhaps never will cease to exist—an
external and an internal protestantism. The pious
and humble Guerin had a servant who, full of admiration
for his master's sermons, was also a great
talker. One day, wishing to do the same as his
master, he began to preach in the open street before
a number of people. 'Why do you go to mass?' he
said: 'you are idolaters.... Instead of worshipping
God, you adore a wafer!' The poor orator was taken
up and compelled to leave the city in consequence of
his sermon. Another day some huguenots entered a
pastrycook's shop: it was a Saturday in Lent. They
asked for a plate of meat. 'Impossible,' said the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">{427}</a></span>
master. 'Not so much ceremony,' rudely returned
the huguenots. The pastrycook ran off to inform
against them, and they were condemned to pay a
fine of sixty sous each, which occasioned some disturbance.
'Lutherans, huguenots, heretics!' shouted
one party; 'Pharisees, mamelukes, papists!' answered
the other.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_623" id="Ref_623" href="#Foot_623">[623]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=OLIVETAN'S WORK.=</p>

<p>In the midst of these disturbances the most important
work of the reformation was progressing at
Geneva. The pious Olivetan was labouring night
and day at the translation of the Bible. He believed
that nothing was more necessary for the Church of
his time, and in his great love for it, he determined
to do all in his power to supply the want. 'O poor
little Church,' he said, 'although thou art desolate,
mis-shapen, and rejected, and countest for the most
part in thy family the blind, the lame, the maimed,
the deaf, the paralytic, orphans and strangers, simple
and foolish ... why should we be ashamed to make
thee such a royal present? Do we not all need the
consolation of Christ? For whom does the Lord
destine his Scripture, if not for his little invincible
band, to whom, as the real leader of the war, he
desires to impart courage and boldness by his
presence?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_624" id="Ref_624" href="#Foot_624">[624]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing disturbed Olivetan so much as the sight of
the Church of his day. The more he studied it, the
more he was grieved by its misery and convinced of
the necessity of a total reformation, accomplished by
the Word of God. Never perhaps had its condition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">{428}</a></span>
caused so profound and keen a sorrow in any one.
When he was alone in his room and seated at his table,
these bitter recollections would recur to him: 'I
love thee,' he exclaimed; 'I have seen thee in the
service of thy hard masters; I have seen thee coming
and going, worried and plagued; I have seen thee
ill-treated, ill-dressed, ill-used, ragged, muddy, torn,
dishevelled, chilled, bruised, beaten, and disfigured....
I have seen thee in such piteous case, that men would
sooner take thee for a poor slave than the daughter of
the universal Ruler, and the beloved of his only Son.
Listen,' added he, 'thy friend calls thee; he endeavours
to teach thee thy rights and to give thee
the watch-word, that thou mayest attain to perfect
freedom.... Stupified and bewildered by so many
blows, bowed down by so many cares brought upon
thee by thy rough masters, wilt thou persevere? wilt
thou go thy ways and complete the foul and grievous
task with which they have burdened thee?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_625" id="Ref_625" href="#Foot_625">[625]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=TRANSLATION OF THE BIBLE.=</p>

<p>But Olivetan soon stopped in the midst of his work
and asked himself whether 'the humble translator' (as
he calls himself) was capable of performing such a
task. He looked upon himself as the meanest of
believers, 'as one of the smallest toes on the lowly
feet of the body of the Church.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_626" id="Ref_626" href="#Foot_626">[626]</a></span>
But his very humility induced him to increase in diligence. He
procured the best copies of the Scriptures and compared,
as he tells us, 'all the translations, ancient and
modern, from the Greek down to the Italian and
German.' Above all, he made great use of the French
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">{429}</a></span>
translation by Lefèvre of Etaples, but rendered certain
passages differently. He studied the various
texts, the use of the Masoretic points, marks, consonants,
aspirates, and unusual expressions. He
deliberated whether he should preserve in French
certain Greek terms, such as <i>apostle</i> and <i>bishop</i>, or
express them by the corresponding word in French.
'If I preserve the Greek word,' he said, 'the thing
which it signifies will remain unknown, just as it has
been to the present day.' He therefore translated the
Greek word <i>apostle</i> by the French word <i>envoyé</i> (sent);
instead of <i>bishop</i> he wrote <i>surveillant</i> (overseer); and
<i>ancien</i> (elder) instead of <i>priest</i>. Then he added
mischievously: 'And if any one is surprised at not
finding certain words in my translation which the
common people have continually on their lips, imagining
they are in Scripture, such as <i>pope</i>, <i>cardinal</i>,
<i>archbishop</i>, <i>archdeacon</i>, <i>abbot</i>, <i>prior</i>, <i>monk</i>, he must
know that I did not find them there, and for that
reason I have not changed them.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_627" id="Ref_627" href="#Foot_627">[627]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 13th March the printer De Vingle asked
permission to print the Bible in French. The council
was much divided, for the friends of the clergy
opposed his prayer. On the one side they called out
<i>Scripture!</i> and on the other <i>Church!</i> The syndics
thought it their duty to steer a middle course, and
granted permission to reprint Lefèvre's Bible without
adding or retrenching a word. They were afraid of
Olivetan's translation, and we shall see by and by
where he was forced to get it printed.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_628" id="Ref_628" href="#Foot_628">[628]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">{430}</a></div>

<p>Another desire absorbed the evangelicals of Geneva
about this time. When Guerin, Levet, Chautemps,
and others met together in some humble room, they
expressed the happiness they should feel at assembling
round the Lord's table to commemorate his death.
They had long ceased to take part in the communion
of the Romish Church, defiled as they thought it by
wretched superstitions; and desired earnestly to see
the Lord's Supper re-established among them in its
apostolic purity. The christians of Geneva asked for
the Bible in the first place, and for the Sacrament in
the second. That is in the regular course. The Word
of God creates the christian: the Lord's Supper
strengthens him. Christ first imparts to his disciples
the knowledge of the truth, which He does by the
ministry of the Word. Then He desires them to
understand that he gives not only christian ideas to
believers, but that he gives himself, his own life—that
he comes (in his own words) to <i>abide in them</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_629" id="Ref_629" href="#Foot_629">[629]</a></span>
This is the second phase of faith, and the Lord's Supper
is its sign.</p>

<p class="side">=GUERIN.=</p>

<p>The christians of Geneva, enlightened by Scripture,
desired the Holy Communion. But, said they, who
will give it us? They had no ministers. Had not
Luther declared ten years before that in order to
avoid irregularity, the assembly, making use of its
right, ought to elect one or more believers to exercise
the charge of the Word, in the name of all.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_630" id="Ref_630" href="#Foot_630">[630]</a></span>
They turned their eyes on Guerin. Few of the reformed
were so much esteemed as he was. Being an evangelical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">{431}</a></span>
christian and not a political huguenot, he had
'an ardent love for his brethren' and a zeal full of
boldness to profess the Gospel. It required some
courage to preside at the Lord's Supper in Geneva in
the presence of the Romish mass. 'The flesh is
always cowardly,' said a christian of Geneva, 'and
pulls backwards, like an aged ass; and accordingly
it needs the goad and spur as much as he does.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_631" id="Ref_631" href="#Foot_631">[631]</a></span>
Guerin possessed, moreover, a cultivated understanding,
and was learned in theology.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_632" id="Ref_632" href="#Foot_632">[632]</a></span></p>

<p>There remained one question: Where should the
communion be held?—'At Baudichon's,' answered
one of them. 'No,' said the more prudent; 'not in
the city for fear of the opposition of the priests, who
are very irritated already.' Upon this Stephen
d'Adda said, 'I have a little walled garden near the
city gates, where nobody can disturb us.' The place
was selected, the day named, and an hour fixed which
would permit them to meet without disturbance. It
was early in the morning, as it would appear.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_633" id="Ref_633" href="#Foot_633">[633]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=FIRST SACRAMENT AT GENEVA.=</p>

<p>When the day arrived, many persons went out of
the city and quietly directed their steps towards
D'Adda's garden, situated in a place called Pré
l'Evêque, because the bishop had a house there.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">{432}</a></span>
A table had been prepared in a room or in the open
air. The believers as they arrived took their seats in
silence on the rude benches, not without fear that
the priests should get information of the furtive meeting.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_634" id="Ref_634" href="#Foot_634">[634]</a></span>
Guerin sat down in front of the table.
Just at the moment (we are told) when the ceremony
was about to begin, the sun rose and illumined with his
first rays a scene more imposing in its simplicity than
the mountains capped with everlasting snow, above
which the star of day was beginning his course. The
pious Guerin stood up, and after a prayer he distributed
the bread and wine, and all together praised the Lord.
The communicants quitted D'Adda's garden full of
gratitude towards God.</p>

<p>It was not long, however, before their peace was
troubled. Their enemies could not contain themselves,
and threatened nothing less than excommunication
and imprisonment. There were disputes. The priests
shrugged their shoulders at the sight of those paltry
assemblies. They said that the reformed, by busying
themselves so much about <i>Christ</i>, deprived themselves
of the <i>Church</i>; while Olivetan and Guerin maintained
that the catholics, by speaking so much of the <i>Church</i>,
deprived themselves of <i>Christ</i>. The meeting of a few
souls endowed with a lively faith, who came to glorify
Jesus Christ, was (they believed) a truer church than
the pope, cardinals, and all the pomps of the Vatican.
The exasperated priests vented their anger specially
on Guerin, and the danger which threatened him was
so great, that he had to leave the city. Hurrying
quickly away, he took refuge at Yvonand with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">{433}</a></span>
friend Froment, from whom he had received so much
enlightenment.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_635" id="Ref_635" href="#Foot_635">[635]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus Farel, Froment, and Guerin were compelled,
one after another, to quit Geneva; but the catholics
laboured in vain: 'the reformed met every day in
houses or gardens to pray to God, to sing psalms
and christian hymns, and to explain Holy Scripture.
And the people began to dispute with the priests, and
to discuss with them publicly.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_636" id="Ref_636" href="#Foot_636">[636]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus there were two winds blowing in different
directions at Geneva—one from the north, the other
from the south. They could not fail to come into
violent collision and to engender a frightful tempest.</p>

It seems clear from Froment's narrative (p. 48) that the first
communion took place before the riots (p. 51), and therefore probably
before the middle of March. Spon confirms Froment's account (i. p. 481).
On the other hand Sister Jeanne de Jussie says that a sacrament was
celebrated after the first riot, on Holy Saturday, April 10th (<i>Le
Levain du Calvinisme</i>, p. 61). The only way of reconciling these two
statements is to admit (as we have done) two different celebrations (in
March and April), and not one only.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">FORMATION OF A CATHOLIC CONSPIRACY.<br />
 (<span class="smc">Lent, 1533.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">EVANGELICAL zeal was the occasion of the persecution.
Its enemies were angered; they could
not understand the inappreciable life then fermenting
among their people. If a meeting was suppressed in
one house, it was held in another. 'They could not
find any remedy against this.'</p>

<p>One, however, offered itself. A dominican monk,
an inquisitor of the Faith, had just arrived in Geneva.
'He is a great orator,' was the report in the city,
'a fervent catholic, just the opposite of Bocquet.' He
had come to preach the Lent sermons in the greyfriar's
stead, and everybody hoped he would repair the
evil the other had done. 'Deliver us from this heresy,'
said the heads of the Dominicans to him. The monk,
flattered by this confidence and proud of his mission,
prepared a fine discourse, and the next day or the
next but one after Guerin's departure he went into
the pulpit. St. Dominic's church was crowded, and
a good many evangelicals, including Olivetan, were
present. After a short introduction the monk began
with loud voice and ardent zeal to decry the Bible, to
abuse the heretics,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_637" id="Ref_637" href="#Foot_637">[637]</a></span>
and to exalt the pope. 'He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">{435}</a></span>
uttered without restraint all that came into his head.'
'I will blacken them so,' he had said, 'that they shall
never be washed clean.'</p>

<p class="side">=OLIVETAN BANISHED FROM GENEVA.=</p>

<p>Great was the excitement among the huguenots.
'If any one of us is so bold as to move his lips,' they
said, 'such a little liberty makes our masters bawl out
like madmen; but they are allowed to pour out their
poison and infect the world with it.' Olivetan, who was
present during the sermon, could hardly contain himself,
but as soon as it was ended, he got upon a bench,
thinking it would be wrong of him not to make the
truth known. 'Master,' he said, 'I desire to show
you honestly from Scripture where you have erred in
your discourse.' These words created great astonishment.
What! a layman presume to teach the Church....
The priests and some of their creatures
surrounded Olivetan, abused him, pushed him off the
bench, and would have beaten him. 'Whereupon up
came Claude Bernard, Jean Chautemps, and others,
who took their friend away from the monks and people
who desired to kill him.'... But he did not
escape so easily: the council sentenced him to banishment,
without hearing or appeal. Everyone regretted
him: 'He was a man,' they said, 'of such learning,
godly life and conversation!' Olivetan was forced to
leave. Geneva, suffering under a violent commotion,
cast off the evangelists one after another, as the sea
casts up the fragments of a wreck.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_638" id="Ref_638" href="#Foot_638">[638]</a></span></p>

<p>The clerical party was beginning to doubt whether
these banishments were enough.... When
Farel was expelled, Froment appeared; when Froment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">{436}</a></span>
had got away, Guerin presided over a Lutheran sacrament;
when Guerin had been obliged to make his escape,
Olivetan got upon a bench in the church and publicly
contradicted an inquisitor! He too was gone, but
others would not fail to come forward....
Canon Wernli, equerry De Pesmes, the bold Thomas
Moine, and other catholic chiefs, thought that an end
should be put to this state of things. The reformed
saw the danger that threatened them. Baudichon de
la Maisonneuve consulted with his friend Claude
Salomon. They argued that as Friburg desired to
enslave their consciences, they ought to apply to Berne
to deliver them. Salomon wished to consult the
Genevese councillors favourable to the Reform. 'No,'
said Baudichon, 'let us ask nobody's opinion; let us
do the business alone. Which of the council would
join us? John Philippe, John Lullin, Michael Sept,
Stephen of Chapeaurouge, Francis Favre, Claude
Roset? True, they are all friends of independence,
but they have an official position. If we apply to
them, we shall only compromise them. We are at
liberty to expose our own lives, but not those of our
friends. Let us go to Berne alone.' Nevertheless
two magistrates, Domaine d'Arlod and Claude Bernard,
were informed of their intention. They were embarrassed,
for they knew that such a step might cost the
lives of those who ventured it. The courage of the
two patriots affected them. 'We believe we are following
God's will,' said Maisonneuve. 'In that case,'
replied Arlod, 'we shall give you no instructions
either verbal or written, we shall only say: <i>Do whatsoever
God shall inspire you to do</i>.' It was with these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">{437}</a></span>
words, recorded in the registers, that the two Genevans
departed for Berne.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_639" id="Ref_639" href="#Foot_639">[639]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=BERNE AND LIBERTY OF WORSHIP.=</p>

<p>As soon as they arrived, they appeared before the
council and explained how the clergy were endeavouring
to stifle the germs of faith in their birth. The
Bernese did not hesitate: greatly irritated by the
violence which the Genevans had used towards Farel,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_640" id="Ref_640" href="#Foot_640">[640]</a></span>
in despite of their letters of recommendation, they
made answer that they would do everything to
support the Gospel in Geneva.</p>

<p>On the 25th of March the council of Geneva met.
There was evidently something new: many of the
members wore an anxious look; others appeared
cheerful. Du Crest, the premier syndic, a man
devoted to the Romish Church, announced with an
air of consternation, that he had just received a letter
from Berne in which the council of Geneva was
severely reprimanded. In truth, the Bernese did
not mince matters: they complained of the violence
done to Farel and the persecution organised in Geneva
against the evangelical faith. 'We are surprised,'
they said, 'that in your city the faith in Jesus Christ
and those who seek it are so molested.... You will
not suffer the Word of God to be freely proclaimed,
and banish those who preach it.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_641" id="Ref_641" href="#Foot_641">[641]</a></span></p>

<p>This letter troubled the council. 'If we concede
what Berne demands,' they said, 'the priests will get
up fresh disturbances. If we refuse, Berne will
break off the alliance, and the reformed will revolt.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">{438}</a></span>
Whichever way they turned, danger seemed to
threaten them. 'So that they knew not what answer
to give,' adds the register. Almost all of them were
enraged against Maisonneuve and Salomon. They
were brought before the council and confessed that
they had gone to Berne and had solicited the letter
which had been sent. Upon this several mamelukes
called out 'treason;' but the consciences of these two
noble citizens bore witness that they had served the
cause of liberty and justice. They remained firm,
and the council, being disturbed and undecided,
adjourned to the next day the question of what was
to be done.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_642" id="Ref_642" href="#Foot_642">[642]</a></span></p>

<p>The agitation spread from the council-room to the
chapter-house and into the city. Everyone spoke
about Berne's demand of full liberty for the gospel.
The canons, priests, and most devout of the laity
were unanimous for refusing; the daring Thomas
Moine became the soul of this movement. They
resolved, upon his proposition, to intimidate the
council and obtain from it the total suppression of
the evangelical meetings. Forthwith the most zealous
of the party went into the city and visited from house to house.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_643" id="Ref_643" href="#Foot_643">[643]</a></span>
At the same time Moine got a few of his
friends together and proposed to go to the council in
a body: their numbers, he doubted not, would overawe
the syndics, and the catholics would obtain their
demands. This measure was resolved upon, and the
meeting fixed for the morrow.</p>

<p class="side">=PROTEST OF THE TWO HUNDRED.=</p>

<p>Next day, when the council met, they were told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">{439}</a></span>
that a considerable number of citizens desired an audience.
They were admitted, to the number of about
two hundred, including Thomas Moine, B. Faulchon,
François du Crest, Percival de Pesmes, and Andrew
Maillard: their countenances bore the mark of violent
passions. 'Most honoured lords,' said Moine, who
was a clever speaker, 'notwithstanding the edict
which bids us live like brothers, many persons are
endeavouring to sow disorder and dissension among
us. Some of them have gone to Berne, and the lords
of that place have written you a letter which disturbs
all the city.... Who are those guilty men who go and
denounce their country to the foreigner? Were they
deputed by the council? What instructions did they
receive? What answer did they bring you? We beg
to be informed on these matters. We wish to know
them, and whether anything has been done tending
to the ruin of the republic.'</p>

<p>The premier-syndic, amazed at such a speech,
begged Moine and his friends to retire, and the embarrassed
council determined to procrastinate.</p>

<p>'We will do everything in the world to bring this
difficult matter to a happy conclusion,' they answered.
'We will assemble the Sixty, the Two Hundred, the
heads of families, even the general council, if necessary
... the whole republic. Rest content with
this promise.'</p>

<p>'We have been deputed,' answered Moine, 'to demand
that you should produce before us those who
went to Berne. We will not leave this room until
we have seen them. If you do not summon them,
we will go and fetch them.'</p>

<p>On hearing these words the council grew alarmed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">{440}</a></span>
What a disturbance and what violence there would be
in the council-chamber if the two huguenots should
appear before these excited catholics!... The syndics
replied that they would return an answer. This
procrastination put the mamelukes beside themselves.
It was not Moine alone who protested: the two hundred
who surrounded him raised their hands and
shouted in menacing tones: 'Justice, justice! Let
us keep our promise to Messieurs of Friburg—that
Geneva would preserve the faith of its fathers.' The
alarmed syndics endeavoured by exceeding gentleness
of manner (says a manuscript) to appease the tumult;
and the two hundred discontented catholics returned
to their homes with haughty look and resolute air.
'If the council haggles any more,' they said, 'we will
do ourselves justice!' In the city, men said: 'We
thought the catholics decrepid, downcast, asleep, or
dead ... but they are opening their heavy eyes;
their strength is returning, and the swift-flying vultures
are about to pounce upon their prey.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_644" id="Ref_644" href="#Foot_644">[644]</a></span></p>

<p>In fact, two of the syndics, and several councillors,
with other laymen of the catholic party and some
priests, went into the city, and endeavoured to persuade
all they met to enter into the plot formed against
the Gospel. They told them that there was nothing
to be expected from the council. 'If the faith of our
fathers is to stand, by our own hands it must be supported,'
they said. 'Hold yourselves in readiness to
march against the Lutherans.'</p>

<p class="side">=AGITATION AGAINST THE LUTHERANS.=</p>

<p>The <i>Lutherans</i>, they said. It was indeed the Reformation
that was then stirring up all the wrath of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">{441}</a></span>
the clerical party. Some of its members, no doubt,
hated liberty as much as the Gospel; but most of the
catholics would have tolerated the ancient franchises
of the people. The point on which they were all
agreed was an unquenchable opposition to that new
doctrine which they called <i>Lutheranism</i>, Luther being
in their opinion its great apostle. This Lutheranism
was fundamentally what was afterwards named Calvinism,
for Luther and Calvin were one in the great
evangelical principles. All the reformers preached in
the sixteenth century, in Europe, and particularly
at Geneva, that the pure grace of God was the only
power of eternal salvation, and that the Church
was composed of all those who possessed true faith,
and not of those who slavishly adhered to a dominating
hierarchy. The doctrines of Lutheranism and
of the Reform<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_645" id="Ref_645" href="#Foot_645">[645]</a></span>
might differ, in regard to certain
abstract questions, as touching the finite and the infinite,
for instance: Lutheranism might put in bolder
relief the <i>immanence</i> of God, while the Reform inclined
towards his <i>transcendance</i>, to use the language
of philosophers and theologians; but they were and
they are agreed in all that is essential; and it was
these living doctrines that a powerful party was
endeavouring to expel from Geneva.</p>

<p class="side">=SECRET PLOTS.=</p>

<p>On Thursday night the canons, priests, and chief
'partisans of the papal religion,' as Wernli, De
Pesmes, Moine, and their friends, met in the vicar-episcopal's
great hall. They arrived one after another,
most of them armed to the teeth, and breathing
vengeance: the room was soon filled, and many stood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">{442}</a></span>
in the courtyard. Their intention was carefully to
arrange the plot that was to free them from the Reform.
Some huguenots, informed of the conspiracy, drew
near to watch their adversaries. The circumstances,
the tumultuous crisis that was approaching, the
interests to be discussed, the violent passions with
which the two parties were animated, the late hour at
which this conference was held—all combined to
render it a solemn one. Men's minds became clouded,
and certain huguenots of ardent imagination, who
gazed at a distance upon the walls behind which these
plotters were assembled, indulging in fantastic visions,
fancied they saw the furies, torch in hand, stirring up discord;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_646" id="Ref_646" href="#Foot_646">[646]</a></span>
but they were merely monks clad in their
long robes, and holding the torches with which the
hall was lighted. At length the proceedings began.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_647" id="Ref_647" href="#Foot_647">[647]</a></span>
Some of the speakers represented that the number of
rebels increased daily; that the sacerdotal authority
decreased proportionately; and that if things were
allowed to go on so, ere long nobody would take any
account of the Church. 'Let us not lower ourselves
to dispute with heretics. Let us not wait for help
from the magistrates. The Council of Sixty is about
to meet, but they will hesitate just like the ordinary
council. Those bodies are too weak; we must act
without the government; we are the strongest. If it
comes to fighting, the defenders of catholicism will be
ten, perhaps twenty, to one. When the evangelists
are conquered, we will invite the bishop back, who
will return with all the banished mamelukes, and
inflict on the rebels the punishment they deserve.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">{443}</a></span>
Geneva, preserved from the Reformation, will no
longer be able to spread it through the surrounding
countries, and will be in future ages the support of the
papacy. Let us execute justice for ourselves; let us
fly to arms, ring the tocsin, draw the sword, and call
upon the faithful to march against those <i>dogs</i>, and
make a striking example of the two traitors who went
to Berne. Let us kill all who are called Lutherans,
without sparing one;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_648" id="Ref_648" href="#Foot_648">[648]</a></span>
which will be doing God a
good service. We are assured of the bishop's pardon:
his lordship has already sent us the pardons in blank.
At the sound of the great bell, let everyone go armed
to the Molard, and let the city gates be shut, so that
nobody may escape.' This is what was said in the
vicar-episcopal's house. The leaders agreed upon the
place of meeting, the number of the armed bands, the
names of those who should command them, and the
manner in which the reformed should be attacked;
everything was arranged. The assembly applauded;
the conspirators, raising their hands, bound themselves
by a solemn oath to execute the plan and to secresy;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_649" id="Ref_649" href="#Foot_649">[649]</a></span>
after which they retired to take a brief
repose. The festival of Easter was approaching:
more than two centuries before, the Sicilian Vespers
had filled Palermo and all Sicily with massacre; the
enemies of the Reformation in Geneva desired also to
celebrate the same festival with rivers of blood.</p>

<p>The Council of Sixty met the next day (Friday,
28th March 1533). Never perhaps was there a body
more divided. When the catholics demanded that
the promise made to Friburg should be kept, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">{444}</a></span>
huguenots represented that if the council decided in
favour of the Romanist party, not only would the
bishop resume his former power, but that having seen
the Reform on the brink of triumphing, he would
throw himself into the arms of Savoy, as the only
power capable of saving the Roman faith. The council,
placed between these two fierce currents, remained in
its usual indecision, and declared in favour of neither.
This was just what the leaders of the Romanist party
expected. Everything was prepared for carrying out
the <i>conspiracy</i> (to use Froment's word) which had
been planned the night before.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_650" id="Ref_650" href="#Foot_650">[650]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE PARTIES ASSEMBLE.=</p>

<p>The cathedral had been selected as the place of
meeting. The first who entered it was the valiant
canon, Peter Wernli. He was armed from head to
foot, and advanced into the sanctuary as a general
goes to battle. Wernli handled the sword as well as
his brother, who was a captain in the service of the
king of France. Gifted with the strength of a Hercules
or a Samson, he designed, like the first, to drive
Cerberus out of the city; and like the second, to pull
down the pillars of the temple. He said to those who
had gathered round him in St. Pierre's: 'We will cut
off the heads of those who went to Berne and of all
their friends.' Three hundred armed canons and
priests came after him, and then a great number of
their lay followers. 'The Lutherans threaten us,' said
some of these angry citizens; 'they want to rob the
churches and convents.' Such a tale could not fail to
excite their minds still more.</p>

<p>The huguenots, informed of the plot arranged at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">{445}</a></span>
the vicar-general's, and observing the catholics making
ready for the attack, saw at once that their first act
would be to seize Baudichon de la Maisonneuve, on
account of his journey to Berne, and inflict on him
the fate of Berthelier and Levrier. They therefore
assembled to the number of sixty around their friend
to defend his life at the price of their blood. Some of
Moine's partisans went to inform the assemblage at
St. Pierre's that they had seen several persons enter
Maisonneuve's house.</p>

<p>This information was a signal of battle to the conspirators.
'Forward!' they cried: 'let us go and
attack them!' Two catholics, friends of peace, who
happened to be in the church (B. Faulchon and
Girardin de la Rive), fearing a civil war, ran to the
council. 'Both parties are under arms,' they said;
'some at St. Pierre's, others at Baudichon's: the first
are preparing to march down against their opponents....
Should they do so, there will be a great disturbance:<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_651" id="Ref_651" href="#Foot_651">[651]</a></span>
look you to it.' The council, suspending
all other business, ordered the four syndics to proceed
with the badges of their office, first to St. Pierre's (for
the aggressors were there), and next to Maisonneuve's,
and command both parties to return immediately to
their homes.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_652" id="Ref_652" href="#Foot_652">[652]</a></span></p>

<p>The task was a difficult one, but the four magistrates
did not hesitate to undertake it. Preceded by
their ushers they entered the cathedral, with the
syndical staff in their hands. At the sight of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">{446}</a></span>
the crowd grew calm. 'We desire to know,' said the
premier-syndic, 'the cause of this meeting.' The
assembly answered with one voice: 'We are going to
fight the Lutherans who are assembled in the Rue des
Allemands. They are always keeping us in fear, and
we must put an end to it. We can no longer endure
such a pest in the city.... They are worse
than the Turks.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_653" id="Ref_653" href="#Foot_653">[653]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=VANDEL WOUNDED.=</p>

<p>At this moment two of the reformed, uneasy as to
what might happen, approached the cathedral, and
mounting the steps before the porch, stood there some
time, peeping into the church, undecided whether
they should enter. The priests and mamelukes perceiving
them, exclaimed: 'Look at the wicked
wretches, they are come to spy the christians!' At
last, with more zeal than prudence, the two evangelicals
entered. They were J. Goulaz and P. Vandel,
the latter a man of twenty-six, who had adopted the
Reform, but always retained a great affection for his
old catholic friends.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_654" id="Ref_654" href="#Foot_654">[654]</a></span>
Addressing the syndics with
great mildness, he said: 'Pray put an end to this
disturbance, lest worse should come of it.' When the
mamelukes heard his words, they became angry and
drew their swords to strike the two huguenots.
Portier, the episcopal secretary, a violent and fanatical
man, seeing Vandel, exclaimed: 'How is it that you
are here, traitor!' Several of them rushed upon
Vandel, threw him to the ground, and trampled on
him; Portier, drawing his dagger (<i>sanguidede</i>) and
seizing the young man 'in a cowardly manner by the
back,' (says the Council Register) stabbed him near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">{447}</a></span>
the left shoulder, intending to kill him. Vandel lay
seriously wounded on the pavement of the cathedral
'with great effusion of blood.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_655" id="Ref_655" href="#Foot_655">[655]</a></span></p>

<p>A crowd of priests immediately gathered round
him and began to lament loudly, not because a man
had been stabbed, but because blood had defiled the
temple. 'Never after was bell rung or divine service
performed in that church, or even in the other churches,
because the mother-church was closed, until it was
purified by My lord the suffragan,' says Sister Jeanne.</p>

<p>Goulaz, it is reported, seeing his friend on the
ground, ran off to the evangelicals and told them all.
Some of them, notwithstanding the danger which they
incurred, proceeded to the cathedral, and obtained the
syndics' permission to carry Vandel away. They
removed him to Baudichon's house, where they got
him to bed. A few huguenots constituted themselves
his nurses, and as they looked on their pale and
blood-stained friend, they asked one another what
would happen next.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XV.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">FIRST ARMED ATTACK OF THE CATHOLICS
 UPON THE REFORMATION.<br />
 (<span class="smc">March 28, 1533</span>).</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THIS effusion of blood, far from calming men's
minds, served but to inflame them. 'All good
christians were more excited than before,' says Sister
Jeanne. The skirmish in which, being seven hundred
against two, they had gained the advantage, was
an omen of victory! They looked at each other and
counted their numbers. 'We are the majority and
well armed,' they said; 'we must sally out boldly and
fight these rascals.' The principal leaders, lay and
ecclesiastic, withdrawing into a private part of the
cathedral, held a final council. The most influential
represented that the huguenots had celebrated the
sacrament, that they persevered in holding their meetings
'here and there,' that the sacerdotal authority
was decreasing and the number of heretics increasing,
and that there was only one means left of saving the
Romish faith—putting every heretic to death.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_656" id="Ref_656" href="#Foot_656">[656]</a></span>
The syndics stretched out their wands in vain, and ordered
them to keep the peace. All was useless. 'Now is
the time,' cried the priests; 'let us run to the great
bell and give the signal.' At the word many hastened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">{449}</a></span>
to the tower of the church and began to ring the
tocsin. At the same time those who were in the
church prepared to march.</p>

<p class="side">=CATHOLICS PREPARE TO FIGHT.=</p>

<p>Three of the syndics were devoted to the catholic
party: Nicholas du Crest, Pierre de Malbuisson, and
Claude Baud. Finding that they could not stop the
riot, they determined if possible to direct it. Claude
Baud, lord of Troches, in whose castle many a plot
had been concocted against the independence of
Geneva, would have desired to make an end of the
Reform, but not by violent means. Seeing, however,
that it was impossible to check the torrent, he put
himself at the head of the <i>émeute</i>, but with the hope of
restraining it, and afterwards of repressing the Reform
by legal means. 'Shut the doors of the church,' said
Baud. This had a surprising effect: the catholics
on a sudden grew calmer. The syndic feared that if
they came to blows, the two parties might become
confused in the battle, and that friends would strike
friends without recognising each other. He ordered
a great bundle of laurel boughs to be brought in, and
addressing the crowd around him, said: 'Formerly,
citizens, they used to give garlands to the conquerors;
I give you these laurels before the victory: they will
distinguish you from the wicked.' The combatants
each took a sprig and fastened it to their caps; and
then the pious catholics who were in the crowd, wishing
to give a religious character to the <i>émeute</i>, proposed
that they should implore the blessing of heaven
before they started. The ecclesiastics were silent
immediately, and turning to the choir, prostrated
themselves in fervent devotion before the high altar.
All present knelt down 'with great abundance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">{450}</a></span>
tears,' and sang the famous hymn of the Roman
breviary:</p>

<p class="center small">Vexilla regis prodeunt.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_657" id="Ref_657" href="#Foot_657">[657]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the strain was ended, one of the priests
said: 'Let us commend ourselves to the blessed
Virgin, that she may intercede for us and for the
holy faith!' And all, as with one voice, joined in
the <i>Salve Regina</i>—a prayer which the people were
accustomed to sing at the execution of a criminal.
The echoes of this ominous chant having died away
in the aisles of the vast cathedral, the priests rose
from their knees: one of them took the cross, while
some laid hold of other banners. 'Behold,' they said,
'behold the standards of the king advancing.' The
excitement grew greater every minute. It was
Friday, the one before Passion Week. 'Let us this
day call to mind the day on which our Lord was
willing to shed his blood for us, and therefore let us
not spare ours. Let us take vengeance on his enemies
who crucify him anew more cruelly than the Jews did.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_658" id="Ref_658" href="#Foot_658">[658]</a></span>
They uttered such cries that 'it was
quite pitiful to hear them,' and 'there was no heart
so hard as not to melt into tears.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_659" id="Ref_659" href="#Foot_659">[659]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE CORPS ARE FORMED.=</p>

<p>All this emotion was not without a cause. The
religion of the middle ages was disappearing. We
believe that it must disappear altogether; and yet we
are touched by the enthusiasm displayed by its adherents,
which was worthy of a better cause. Syndic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">{451}</a></span>
Baud, who wished to give an appearance of legality
to the clerical movement, called Percival de Pesmes,
and ordered him to go with a body of men and fetch
the banner of the city. At length the great bell,
which had kept on ringing, was silent; the ringers
came down from the tower and joined the rest of
their party. The churchmen then formed into companies
and elected their captains; all were full of
courage and ardour, and St. Pierre's resembled a parade-ground
rather than a church. The companies defiled
in front of the high altar, and the syndic, ordering
the doors to be thrown open, all the clerical army
quitted the temple, descended with a firm step the
steep street of the Perron, and proceeded towards the
Molard, which was the general rendezvous for those
who desired on that day to destroy both the reformed
and the Reformation in Geneva.</p>

<p>As soon as the tocsin was heard, the city was
agitated to its most retired quarters, and even the inhabitants
of the surrounding districts had listened with
alarm to its ill-omened sound. The startled and uneasy
citizens caught up their arms, rushed hastily from
their houses, and ran 'like poor wandering sheep
without a shepherd,' some one way, some another,
not knowing where to go, what was the matter, and
whether the enemy was within the walls or without.
The peasants of the vicinity, forewarned by the agents
of the canons, entered the city in arms. The confusion
continued to increase: some cried 'Fire,' others
'Fall on;' all shouted 'Alarm, alarm!' Some ran to the
gates, others to the hôtel-de-ville, and others to the
ramparts; but the priests who had contrived the
affair, and who were marching 'in large bands' from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">{452}</a></span>
different quarters towards the Molard, excited the
ignorant people to follow them, and shouting so as to
drown all other cries, 'Down with the Lutherans,'
thus made it known who were the enemies to be
attacked. 'To the Molard,' they added; 'Down
with the dogs that want to destroy our holy mother
Church.' No fervent catholic hesitated; all ran along
the streets, isolated or in bands; they drew their
swords, then arquebusses rattled.... It was like a
flock of birds in search of their prey, opening their
talons, and plunging swiftly upon the Molard.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_660" id="Ref_660" href="#Foot_660">[660]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE MUSTERING OF THE HOSTS.=</p>

<p>Meanwhile the main clerical body, that which started
from St. Pierre's, arrived. It numbered from six to seven
hundred men—canons, priests, monks, sacristans, and
devout laymen, all well armed, Syndic Baud marching
at their head, and 'wearing his great hat and feathers.'
When this body debouched on the square by the
arcade of the Fort de l'Ecluse, the Molard and
adjacent streets were filled with an agitated and confused
crowd. But immediately, by the syndic's order,
companies were formed in imitation of that of St.
Pierre's, and all the people put themselves 'in order
for fighting.' Baud having thus drawn out his corps,
proceeded to count them: there were about 2,500 men,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_661" id="Ref_661" href="#Foot_661">[661]</a></span>
not reckoning the old men, women, and
children, who shouted and wept, and although unarmed,
added to the tumult. The catholics were
full of hope. To the majority of them, the struggle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">{453}</a></span>
was a mere party matter; but others, better instructed
and better theologians than the rest, felt that it was
an effort to expel for ever from Geneva the doctrines
of protestantism touching the pre-eminence of Holy
Scripture, justification, works, the mass, the Church,
and especially grace, to which alone the Reformation
attributed salvation, while the Romish Church claimed
a part in conversion for the natural powers of man,
and looked upon this difference between the two
Churches as the essential point. At the same time,
however, it must be acknowledged that just then they
troubled themselves very little about theology. Being
ready to contend with the arms of men of war, the
two bodies were especially animated by political
passions. The catholics feared lest their enemies
should succeed in escaping. 'Shut the gates of the
city,' said the syndic, 'so that no one can take flight.'
Again cries were heard: 'Forward, lead us to Baudichon's.'
'No,' answered Baud, 'let us wait for the
other corps before we attack.'</p>

<p>There were still three bands to come: the first,
commanded by the bishop's equerry, Percival de
Pesmes, was to come straight from the hôtel-de-ville,
bringing the banner, as we have said; the second,
commanded by Canon de Veigy, descending from the
west, was to make for the Molard by the Rue de la
Cité; the third, coming from the suburb of St.
Gervais, was to cross the Rhone bridge, and was commanded
by Captain Bellessert. 'He was a stout fellow
and like a madman,' says Froment. The band that
he conducted was the most violent in the republic.
These three corps united with the 2,500 men already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">{454}</a></span>
at the Molard could not fail to give the death-blow
to the reformed and the Reformation.</p>

<p>But as they did not appear, the catholics and
mamelukes who were ready for fighting, zealous
in the cause of the pope, and overflowing with
hatred for the Reform, became impatient, and
striking the ground with the butt-ends of their
guns, desired to march forthwith. 'Forward!' they
cried. 'Let us wait,' said the syndic, whether
because he feared that 'their business would not
take well,' as the chronicle says; or because he
wished by an imposing force to constrain the reformed
to surrender without fighting; or, lastly,
because he hoped that if he procrastinated, some
unforeseen circumstance might happen to disarm
the combatants. 'We want artillery,' he said, 'to
besiege Baudichon's house.' This quieted the most
ardent, by giving them something to do; they hurried
off to the arsenal, but it was doubtful whether it
would be opened to them, as the captain-general was
opposed to them. The artillery-keeper, named Bossu
(hunchback), in consequence of his infirmity, a man
of vulgar character and suspected morals, and a strong
partisan of the priests, did not hesitate. He delivered
up the artillery to the catholics, who dragged away
the cannon with much uproar, planted them in the
square, and loaded them.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_662" id="Ref_662" href="#Foot_662">[662]</a></span></p>

<p>At this moment arrived the band led by the descendant
of the crusaders, the young and dashing
Percival de Pesmes, eager to fight, like his fathers, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">{455}</a></span>
the pope and his Church against these new Saracens.
He bore the great banner with pride, and, defiling with
his corps, drew them up in line of battle. Syndic Baud
took the banner from his hands, and planted it in the
middle of the square. The people, electrified at the
sight, 'raised a loud shout.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_663" id="Ref_663" href="#Foot_663">[663]</a></span>
There is no longer any
doubt: the republic is arming, the city banner floats
above the catholic ranks, and the huguenots are
only rebels.</p>

<p class="side">=THE NUNS OF SAINT CLAIRE.=</p>

<p>The monks took the most active part in this business;
the convents were therefore empty, all but that
of Saint Claire, which alone was not deserted. The
nuns, however, wished to take part in the struggle:
'Alas!' they said, 'our worthy fathers have gone to
share in the fight with a number of monks, because
it is in behalf of the faith.... Let us kneel before
God that He may show mercy to the poor city.' The
mother abbess drew a cross of ashes on the foreheads
of the sisters, after which they marched in procession
round the cloister, invoking in devout litanies
the protection of the whole celestial choir. Then
forming a cross, they took their places in the middle
of the choir, and there, distracted and weeping, they
fell on their knees and cried aloud: 'Mercy, O God!
through the intercession of the glorious Virgin Mary
and all the Saints! Give victory to the Christians,
and bring the poor wanderers back to the way of
salvation.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_664" id="Ref_664" href="#Foot_664">[664]</a></span></p>

<p>At this moment the sisters heard a noise at the
gate of the convent: it was a few good catholic women
who, very much afraid themselves, came to bring the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">{456}</a></span>
sisters tidings calculated to add to their distress. 'If
the heretics win the day,' they said, 'they will certainly
make you all marry, young and old—all to
your perdition.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_665" id="Ref_665" href="#Foot_665">[665]</a></span>
This was the customary bugbear
of the poor nuns. They were superstitious and even
fanatical, but nothing indicates that they were not pure.
A tradition to the effect that there was an underground
communication between their convent and that of the
gray friars is a fiction as void of foundation as the
frightful news of a <i>forced marriage</i> brought by their
indiscreet friends. The terrified nuns crossed themselves,
sang their litanies once more, and cried louder
than ever: 'O holy Virgin, give victory to the
Christians!'</p>

<p class="side">=A CRUEL HUSBAND.=</p>

<p>The agitation in the city was then at its height;
the shouts of the priests were frightful,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_666" id="Ref_666" href="#Foot_666">[666]</a></span>
They bawled lustily to those who lagged behind, exhorted
those who appeared indifferent, and animated the
whole body with voice and gesture, as hunters urge
their hounds after the stag. The catholics responded
to the tumultuous clamours of these ministers of
disorder and strife. But the tempest was not confined
to the streets: scenes still more harrowing were
taking place in the houses. 'Alas!' said the wisest
men, 'there is no humanity left, and they take no
account of the ties of nature.' One of the most fiery
catholics, hearing the tocsin, was hurriedly fitting on
his armour, when his wife, a fervent Romanist like himself,
and whose father was at the head of the Lutherans,
was filled with terror at seeing her husband's animation,
and looked at him with a dejected countenance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">{457}</a></span>
She was Micah, daughter of Baudichon de la Maisonneuve.
Her catholic faith did not make the young
wife forget the sweet and holy ties that bind a child
to her father. She shuddered at each malediction
uttered by her husband against the author of her
days. At length her grief broke out in a flood of
tears. Her fanatical husband, exasperated to the
highest degree against Maisonneuve, who was regarded
as the main support of the heresy, turned back and,
without showing the least pity, said: 'Wife, cry as
much as you please. If we come to blows and I meet
your father, he shall be the first on whom I shall try
my strength.... I will kill him, or he shall kill me.'
And then, callous at the sight of Micah, whose tears
flowed faster at these words which pierced her heart,
the barbarous husband said as he left her: 'He is a
bad Christian, a renegade, the worst of the worst—this
wretched Baudichon!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_667" id="Ref_667" href="#Foot_667">[667]</a></span>
Micah was twice married:
first to Bernard Combet, and secondly to Guyot
Taillon. We have not been able to discover which of
her two husbands was so cruel; probably it was
the first.</p>

<p>These distressing scenes became more heart-rending
every moment. In the houses nothing was heard but
the cries and groans of mothers and wives, of daughters
and young children. The streets echoed with
the oaths of the men who cursed <i>that law</i> (the Reformation),
and the first man who had brought it there.
'In truth, it is not possible,' says the chronicler, 'to
describe the cries and tears which then filled the
whole city.' But the mournful sounds of grief and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">{458}</a></span>
sorrow which rose in the air could not drown the
fanatical and sonorous voices of the priests.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_668" id="Ref_668" href="#Foot_668">[668]</a></span></p>

<p>During this time a deep and solemn awe prevailed
in Baudichon's house. The evangelicals were not
insensible to the hatred which was arrayed against
them, but the greatness of the danger gave them that
calmness which the Christian experiences in the presence
of death. The strong encouraged the weak,
addressing them in words of piety and feeling: 'Ah!'
they said, 'if all the world would agree in the truth,
we should be at peace; but as the majority fight
against it, we cannot confess Christ without encountering
resistance and hatred. It is the malice of the
wicked one that divides us into contrary bands, and
everywhere kindles strife and debate.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_669" id="Ref_669" href="#Foot_669">[669]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=NOVEL REINFORCEMENT.=</p>

<p>An unexpected reinforcement added to the numbers
of the catholic troop. The women of that party
had not all a tender soul and bruised heart, like
Baudichon's daughter: the virtues of the evangelical
women, the eagerness with which they had renounced
their jewels and dress in favour of the poor, had excited
the displeasure of many of them; and the thought
that they no longer came to kneel with them at the
altar of Mary, had filled them with anger and hatred.
The tempest then sweeping through the city
fanned the evil passions of the weaker sex. In every
house the wives and sisters, and even the mothers of
the catholics got ready; they assembled the children
from twelve to fifteen years old, and proceeded with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">{459}</a></span>
them to the Place d'Armes, where they had agreed to
meet. 'In this assemblage of women,' says Sister
Jeanne, who was very intimate with them, 'there were
full seven hundred children from twelve to fifteen
years old, firmly resolved to do good service along
with their mothers.'</p>

<p>When these ladies met, they held a parliament of a
new sort; and their speeches were far more impassioned
than those of the men. They had no doubt
that their husbands would put all their adversaries to
death, but were vexed to think that their wives would
be left alive. 'If it should happen,' said one of them,
'that our husbands fight against the unbelievers, let
us also make war and <i>kill their heretic wives, in order
that the breed may be extirpated</i>.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_670" id="Ref_670" href="#Foot_670">[670]</a></span>
This was the only way, these pious ladies thought, of preserving Geneva
catholic; if the wives and children were spared, the
heresy would shoot forth again in a few years. A
unanimous cry of approval was raised by the women,
and even by the accompanying children, and the
Amazons immediately prepared for the combat. They
armed their children, distributing little hatchets and
swords among them; when there were no more weapons
to give out, their mothers told them to fill their
hats and caps with stones. They, too, fiercely gathered
up their aprons, which they filled with missiles. Sister
Jeanne does not omit a single detail in her narrative,
for it is of this that she is most proud. Some of
these women had stationed themselves at the windows
to crush the evangelicals at the moment of battle by
pouring their missiles down upon them; but the more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">{460}</a></span>
determined marched with the children to the Molard,
where they arrived with loud shouts. Strange madness!
as if God who requires in the Christian woman
<i>a meek and quiet spirit</i>, and forbids her to be
adorned 'with braided hair and costly array,' did not
all the more forbid her to arm herself with stones and
march to battle. Frenzied and guilty women! Some
huguenots, observing them from afar, asked with
astonishment what could be the meaning of such a
singular assemblage. They seemed to resemble those
druidesses who (as it is related) when their sanctuary
was threatened, ran to and fro along the shore
of the lake, in black robes with hair dishevelled, and
waving torches in their hands.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_671" id="Ref_671" href="#Foot_671">[671]</a></span></p>

<p>Delighted at the sight, the priests, unwilling to be
behindhand, exclaimed: 'We will be the first to defend
our spouse the Church.' There were about one
hundred and sixty armed priests in the square. If
the clergy and women set the example, shall the citizens
remain behind? The whole body assembled at the
Molard shouted again and again 'Forward, forward!'
The syndics did not incline to attack, but the excited
crowd carried them away.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_672" id="Ref_672" href="#Foot_672">[672]</a></span>
The plan was to
march to Baudichon's house, where the huguenots had
assembled, to set fire to it, and thus, having forced
them to come out, to murder them as they were escaping
from the flames by the doors and windows.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_673" id="Ref_673" href="#Foot_673">[673]</a></span>
Citizens, priests, women and even children, wished to have the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">{461}</a></span>
privilege of being the first to strike Maisonneuve, Salomon,
and their friends; torrents of heretical blood
were to flow in the streets. 'Forward!' they
repeated, but amid the general agitation the beautiful
plumes that ornamented the syndic's hat remained
stationary. Baud wishing to temporise, and to avoid
bloodshed, refused to give the signal: 'To be more sure,'
he said, 'and in order that none may escape from our
hands, let us wait for the corps from St. Gervais.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_674" id="Ref_674" href="#Foot_674">[674]</a></span>
The syndic still hoped that the reformed would lay down
their arms and surrender at discretion to an imposing
force.</p>

<p class="side">=FEELINGS OF THE REFORMED.=</p>

<p>The reformed assembled in Baudichon's house on
the left bank of the river, at the corner of the streets
of the Allemands and of the Corraterie (about 450
paces from the Molard) had gradually seen their
numbers increase. Many of their friends, who at first
desired to remain at home, observing the danger that
threatened their brethren, had come to their help, determined
to conquer or die with them. The enthusiasm
had spread even to the children and excited
them to acts of devotedness beyond their years. 'A
young apprentice went there, in spite of father, mother,
and priests, and exhorted them all to be of good cheer.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_675" id="Ref_675" href="#Foot_675">[675]</a></span>
The elder portion were not blind to the gravity of the
situation, but they remained firm, being full of confidence
in God. 'As a spark,' they said, 'may suddenly
set fire to a whole city, so Geneva has in an instant
been stirred up to riot.... But let not our
hearts be troubled; the Lord holds the tempests and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">{462}</a></span>
whirlwinds in His hand, and can appease them whenever
He pleases.'</p>

<p>Sinister omens might intimidate them. They had
before them the unhappy Vandel, faint and bleeding....
They approached the wounded young man
with compassion. 'See,' they said, 'see how the bishop
and his officers treat the best citizens.' Noticing the
paleness of his face, they despaired of his life, and
gloomy thoughts filled their hearts.</p>

<p class="side">=PRAYER OF THE REFORMED.=</p>

<p>This was not the only presage of the danger that
threatened them; the shouts of the catholics, increasing
in violence, reached even there. They looked at
each other with astonishment and even with alarm.
'What fury!' they said; 'how large a number against
so few!' And some of them added: 'If God be not
for us, we are undone.' But others, changing the
words, answered: '<i>If God be for us, who can be against
us?</i>' De la Maisonneuve was the firmest. Possessing
a quick and even violent temper, an enthusiast for
liberty and truth, he was at this solemn hour calm,
thoughtful, and christianlike. No one was more exposed
than he: his house was to be as it were the battle-field;
but forgetful of self, he went up to such as were
dejected and said: 'We must show our magnanimity,
even should they drive us to despair. The wicked are
already erecting triumphal arches ... in the air.
God does not look to numbers, be they great or small,
but to the cause for which they fight. If we are
under the banner of Jesus, God will be a wall of brass
to us.' These words encouraged such as were shaken,
and gave joy to their afflicted hearts; and scarcely had
Baudichon uttered them than those who stood round
him fell on their knees and bowed before the Lord.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">{463}</a></span>
One of them prayed: 'O God, thou givest the rein to
the wicked only so far as is necessary to try us. Stop
them, therefore, and restrain them, lest they hurt us.
Change the hearts of our enemies, and look only to
the cause for which we are going to fight.' This
simple prayer availed more than a <i>Salve Regina</i>.
Rising from their knees, the friends of the Reform
stretched out their hands and said: 'We swear to die
in God's cause, and to keep faith and loyalty with one
another.' And, like the martyrs of the early ages,
they waited for the blow with which they were
threatened, because they refused to abandon the Gospel
which God was then restoring to Christendom.</p>

<p>While the evangelicals were praying, the band so
impatiently expected from St. Gervais began to cross
the bridge at last. The ex-syndic Jean-Philippe, now
captain-general, who inclined to the Reform from
political motives, being called by his office to repress
all disorder, had taken his post between the bridge
and the city, near Baudichon's house, and those who
belonged to neither party had rallied round him. Just
as the corps from the suburb was debouching from
the bridge and entering the city, Philippe ordered
them to return. At these words their leader, Bellessert
the butcher, furious at the attempt to stop him,
flew into a passion, and with horrible oaths struck the
captain-general so violently with his halberd that he
fell to the ground. At the instant Claude de Genève,
and other citizens who followed Philippe, dashed forward
to meet the assailants; the captain sprang to his
feet, and, turning sword in hand upon the man who
had struck him, wounded Bellessert. At the same
time, his followers, hitting right and left, drove the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">{464}</a></span>
St. Gervaisians back upon the bridge. The latter
attempted in vain to resume the offensive; Philippe's
troop did not give them time to breathe. Many had
been wounded, and disorder was in their ranks; they
were too proud and violent to give way if they had
not suffered much loss. At last they fled and returned
dejected to their houses.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_676" id="Ref_676" href="#Foot_676">[676]</a></span>
The captain's followers immediately closed the bridge gate to prevent
the people of the suburb from returning into the
city.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_677" id="Ref_677" href="#Foot_677">[677]</a></span></p>

<p>This measure exposed the reformed in St. Gervais
to some danger. Aimé Levet lived, as we have said,
at the other end of the bridge. His wife, distressed
at the struggle and the wounds her brethren were
about to give and to receive, had gone out, imprudently
perhaps, and standing in the street, tried to discover
what was going on. At this moment, the catholic
women of the quarter, inflamed by the sight of their
idol Bellessert's wounds, and determined not to be
behind the women of the city in warlike zeal, caught
sight of Claudine Levet, to whom they attributed all
the mischief. With a loud cry they rushed upon her,
exclaiming: 'Let us begin the war by throwing this
dog into the Rhone.' Claudine, seeing the furies
coming, uttered a shriek, and 'being tricky,' according
to Sister Jeanne, returned hastily into the house
and shut the door. It was certainly a very lawful
<i>trick</i>. The catholic women instantly moved to attack
it: but much as they tried to break the door down,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">{465}</a></span>
they could not succeed. They then vented their fury
on the apothecary's drugs: at first they took what
served for show, and then entering the shop 'threw
them all contemptuously into the street.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_678" id="Ref_678" href="#Foot_678">[678]</a></span>
This expedition against the drugs did not calm them: leaving
the shop and standing in front of the house, they
turned their angry eyes to Claudine's windows and
used insulting language. Madame Levet remained
calm in the midst of the uproar, and 'raised her
thoughts to heaven, where she found great matter of
joy to blot out all her sorrows.' At last the catholics
retired, 'very wroth because they could not get at
this woman or any other.' Claudine was saved.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_679" id="Ref_679" href="#Foot_679">[679]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=PLAN TO BURN OUT THE HUGUENOTS.=</p>

<p>While this was going on, the third band expected
at the Molard, that headed by Canon Veigy, had
assembled in the upper part of the city. The immobility
of the reformers, who did not leave Baudichon's
house, fretted the canon and those whom he commanded.
'They keep themselves still as hares,' he
said: 'we must compel them to leave their form.' This
they prepared to do. It had been decided, as we
have said, by Moine and his friends, the chiefs of the
movement, that they should surround and set fire to
Baudichon's house, so that the heretics should be
stifled, burnt, driven out, and dispersed. In the
opinion of some it was a capital idea of the huguenots
to shut themselves up in one house, for by this means
a single match would suffice to get rid of them....
But the plan of fire-raising was not to everybody's
taste. 'It cannot be done without great mischief,'
said the wiser heads; 'the whole street might be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">{466}</a></span>
burnt down.'... The barbarous plan had, however,
been resolved on, and its execution entrusted to Canon
Veigy's corps. It was a churchman who had been
charged with the cruel duty. 'Canon de Veigy was
to pass through the narrow street of the Trois Rois,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_680" id="Ref_680" href="#Foot_680">[680]</a></span>
behind the Rhone, set fire to Baudichon's house,
and drive <i>the others</i> into the street, so that they could
escape nowhere.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_681" id="Ref_681" href="#Foot_681">[681]</a></span></p>

<p>The canon's band was preparing to descend into
the city to perform its task, when some catholics,
running to the hôtel-de-ville, announced the defeat of
the troops from St. Gervais. 'We may expect a
similar encounter,' said the canon and his subordinates;
and being not at all eager to measure weapons
with the captain-general, they resolved to join the
crowd on the Molard, by passing to the east, in order
to be out of the reach of Philippe's attack, and to
have a reinforcement to burn the huguenots. Changing
their direction, they descended by the Rue Verdaine.
When they arrived at the Molard, they were
very ill received. Everybody reproached them,
calling them cowards and traitors. The priest-party
were 'greatly astonished and vexed because they had
not set fire to the house, as had been agreed upon.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_682" id="Ref_682" href="#Foot_682">[682]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=HUGUENOTS ON THE DEFENSIVE.=</p>

<p>The news of this scheme for burning them out had
reached the citadel of the reformed. Maisonneuve
and his friends hesitated no longer. Thus far they
had responded to the fury of their adversaries by remaining
quiet; they desired as much as possible to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">{467}</a></span>
spare the effusion of blood; but now their moderation
became useless. At first they had been only sixty,
their numbers had increased, but they were still
inferior to their adversaries: they determined, however,
to repel force by force.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_683" id="Ref_683" href="#Foot_683">[683]</a></span>
They sallied forth,
therefore, calm and silent, for they felt the gravity of
the moment. On arriving in the Rue des Allemands
they drew up in line of battle five deep, according to
the Swiss practice. The front rank was about 250
paces from the enemy. They were determined not to
take the offensive. 'We will wait for our adversaries,'
they said; 'but if they attack us, we will sooner die
than retreat a single step.'</p>

<p>Although they were, as we have said, by no means
numerous in comparison with the several catholic
bands, they were firm and full of hope. There were
neither priests, women, nor children with them to
embarrass them: all were stout, resolute, disciplined
men, who feared not to fight one against ten. They
did not, however, place their confidence in their
strength; they did 'not turn from one side to the
other to set their hopes in vain things;' the most
pious among them 'repeated that there was not one
spark of certain help for them except in God alone.'</p>

<p>The fight was about to begin. The reformed,
knowing that the city artillery had been surrendered
by the Bossu to their adversaries and pointed at the
Molard, had procured some cannon, probably by the
intervention of the captain-general. The huguenots
marching boldly on two sides of the great square, had
planted their guns—some in the Rue du Rhone, others
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">{468}</a></span>
in the Rue du Marché, only ninety paces from the
catholics. On each side the artillery was ready to be
discharged, the arquebuses were loaded, the spears
and halberds were in the hands of the combatants, the
women and children of the Romish party were bringing
stones. There were transports of anger, cries,
and terrible threats.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_684" id="Ref_684" href="#Foot_684">[684]</a></span>
All were prepared for the
onset, and a massacre seemed inevitable.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_685" id="Ref_685" href="#Foot_685">[685]</a></span></p>

<p>At this moment the sound of a trumpet was heard;
it was not the signal of battle, but the prelude: the
city crier, stopping at the corner of some neighbouring
street, proclaimed, 'that every foreigner should retire
to his lodging under pain of three lashes with a rope.'
In this way they cleared the place where the battle
was to be fought. The trumpet and the crier's shrill
voice soon died away, and there was a deathlike silence.
On each side there were noble souls, lovers of peace,
who were a prey to the deepest emotions at the
thought that brothers were about to attack brothers,
and many turned a sorrowful look on the streets that
were soon to be stained with the blood of their fellow-citizens.
These compassionate men would have liked
to restrain the fratricidal arms, but they trembled
before the priests. 'No one,' says a contemporary,
'dared venture to speak to the ecclesiastics to propose
peace; the great pride of the priests intimidated them,
and they feared to be called Lutherans.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_686" id="Ref_686" href="#Foot_686">[686]</a></span>
To desire to prevent the shedding of blood, was to be a partisan
of the Reformation.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_687" id="Ref_687" href="#Foot_687">[687]</a></span>
The parties cast threatening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">{469}</a></span>
glances at each other, and the two armies were about
to come into violent collision.</p>

<p class="side">=PRAYERS AND TEARS.=</p>

<p>Then the agony burst forth. Some of the wives,
mothers, and daughters, who were in the Place
du Molard, and who up to this moment had been full
of ardour for the combat, were moved and could not
restrain their anguish. The tenderness of their sex
resumed its sway: they let go their aprons, and the
stones contained in them fell to the ground. They
burst into tears and gave utterance to long and sorrowful
moaning. 'Alas!' they said, 'the father is
armed against the son, brother against brother, neighbour
against neighbour.... They are all ready
to kill one another.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_688" id="Ref_688" href="#Foot_688">[688]</a></span>
The emotion became almost universal.</p>

<p>Whilst many of the catholic women were thus
transformed, the evangelical women who remained at
home were praying. They reflected that, however the
world may torment and vex, nothing can happen but
what God Himself has ordained. They put the immutable
decree of the Lord, who wills to maintain the
kingdom of His Son for ever, in opposition to the
wicked conspiracies by which the men of the world
assail it, and doubted not that God would look upon
and help them in their necessity.</p>

<p>'It was God's will,' said Froment, 'to avoid bloodshed,
and He ordained it accordingly.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_689" id="Ref_689" href="#Foot_689">[689]</a></span></p>

<p class="drop-cap">JUST at that time some foreigners were staying
in Geneva, and particularly seven merchants of
Friburg, who had come for the fair. They looked
with sorrow on the spectacle around them, and could
not understand how citizens could go so far as to kill
one another, 'to satisfy the appetite of their priests,'
says a manuscript.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_690" id="Ref_690" href="#Foot_690">[690]</a></span>
These worthy Switzers came
forward to mediate. The chiefs of the catholic party,
not doubting that they were on their side, asked for
their support. 'We do not meddle in business of this
kind,' wisely answered the Friburgers, 'except it be
to restore peace, since we are co-burghers and good
friends with you as well as with the others.' They
proceeded to the Rue des Allemands and said to the
reformed: 'Look at the great multitude of people
that is against you. This matter must be settled
before worse befals you.' The reformed, who were
ready for the battle, made answer: 'The disturbance
did not begin with us, and we should be distressed to
do anything to the disadvantage of the Council or of
the people. We only ask to be left at peace and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">{471}</a></span>
live according to God, obeying the magistrates, as the
Gospel commands. We are acting in self-defence, for
they have conspired to kill us. If so many priests
and monks remain assembled in the square, rest
assured that we shall defend ourselves to the last, if it
please God to assist us. But we are not pleased at
having to fight against fathers, brothers, relations,
friends and neighbours to gratify the appetites of the
priests and monks.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_691" id="Ref_691" href="#Foot_691">[691]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=MODERATION OF THE FRIBURGERS.=</p>

<p>The Friburgers, encouraged by these words, returned
to the Molard and addressing the priests, said:
'It is neither good nor honourable, and above all it is
not in accordance with your office, thus to excite the
people to kill one another. It is your duty to be in
your houses or at church praying to God rather than
be thus in arms. When the people are at variance,
you should reconcile them instead of exciting them to
shed blood.' These were christian words, and the
laymen delivered an excellent exhortation to the
clergy; but the latter were so enraged that they
would listen to nothing. After the pacific address of
the Friburgers, 'they showed themselves more heated
than ever in their desire that all should be killed.'</p>

<p>These worthy merchants, astounded at finding ecclesiastics
so eager for battle, thought that the laymen
would be more moderate, and went off to parley with
the magistrates. 'If there is any bloodshed,' they
said, 'all the blame will be laid on you. Do your
duty: it is yours to command; order the two parties
to withdraw to their homes.' The honour of the
magistrates, who at heart desired peace, was touched,
and they resolved to put down the tumult. Turning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">{472}</a></span>
to the priests, upon whom the whole affair depended,
they said to them before the people: 'You must
restore peace.' But the clergy would do nothing, and
indeed excited the people all the more to attack the
Lutherans. The indignant Friburgers determined to
frighten them. 'We pray you, sirs, not to be so
high,' they said, 'for if it should come to fighting, we
would rather be on their side than on yours....
They are very different soldiers from you, in better
order and well-armed ... we have seen them.'
Then pointing to the listening people, they continued:
'Do you think, sir priests, that the men here, who
have their children, parents, and friends on the other
side, wish to kill them or to be killed by them for love
of you?... Indeed, we pray them to withdraw.
And if after that you desire to attack your enemies,
think what you are about; perchance, you may not
have the opportunity of returning.'</p>

<p>The worthy Friburgers did not stop here; after
speaking to the magistrates and priests, they began to
harangue the people. Approaching the citizens, they
spoke to them singly: 'You have sons, relations, and
friends on the huguenot side; do you want to kill
them, or be killed by them? We advise you to let
the priests fight it out by themselves.'</p>

<p>Many highly approved of this remonstrance. 'We
are very foolish,' they said; 'why should we get
killed for the priests?... Let them defend themselves,
if they like. Let them contend with Holy
Scripture and not with the sword.' Some whom
reason could not convince were seized with fear.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_692" id="Ref_692" href="#Foot_692">[692]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">{473}</a></span>
The good sense of the Friburgers dissipated the charm
of sacerdotal fanaticism. The natural affections,
repressed for a moment, resumed their power. 'Let
the affair be arranged,' was the cry from all quarters;
'Arbitrate, arbitrate.'</p>

<p class="side">=A CONSULTATION.=</p>

<p>The magistrates, seeing the priests deserted, regained
their courage. There was not a moment to
be lost. The council assembled in the middle of the
Molard, the ushers keeping off the crowd; the syndics
were the first to protest against the spilling of blood;
many influential councillors supported them, and the
majority of the people seemed to declare in favour of
peace. Then the premier-syndic, Nicholas du Crest,
Claude Baud, and Pierre de Malbuisson, attended
by several captains, advanced to treat with De la
Maisonneuve and his friends. The foremost of the
huguenots, seeing them approach, thought that the
battle was beginning, and one of them, a prompt and
energetic man, arranging a piece of artillery, began
to take aim at the centre of the group, and got ready
to apply the match. 'The shot would have made a
terrible breach,' says Froment. This rapid movement
alarmed those who were approaching; on all sides
they shouted out, 'Peace is made.' At these words
the gunner stopped, the soldiers drew back, the syndics
came forward on one side, Baudichon and his
friends on the other, and the two parties conferred
together.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_693" id="Ref_693" href="#Foot_693">[693]</a></span></p>

<p>Confidence was not yet restored. It was agreed to
give hostages: three notable men were given up on
each side, and among the six was a canon named
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">{474}</a></span>
Guet. Immediately the sound of the trumpet was
heard in the city, and the herald proclaimed: 'Every
man shall lay down his arms and return quietly home,
without quarrel or dispute, under pain of being
hanged; and no one shall sing song or ballad, provoking
to quarrel, under pain of being whipped and
banished.'</p>

<p>The most diverse opinions prevailed at that moment
in the city. The priests and fervent disciples of
Rome could find no comfort. Wishing to destroy
the Reformation at any cost, they thought it very
christian-like to put the reformed to death. They were
particularly envenomed against the captain-general;
some of them publicly called him a traitor. 'This
peace vexes the christians sorely,' writes Sister Jeanne;
and accordingly they were heard exclaiming: 'We
ought now to <i>despatch them from the world</i>, in order
to be no more frightened or vexed on their account.'
'To say the truth,' adds the devout nun, 'it would
have been better than letting them live.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_694" id="Ref_694" href="#Foot_694">[694]</a></span></p>

<p>But while some of the catholic leaders, as Wernli
and Moine, returned home gloomy and discontented,
hoping that the business was merely adjourned; others,
both reformed and catholics, gladly recrossed the
thresholds of their homes, and were welcomed with
tears of joy. Wives embraced their husbands, the
little children clung round their fathers, while the
elder ones took off their swords. The politicians
smiled as they witnessed the joy of some and the
chagrin of others; they shook their heads and thought
that one party or the other would break the truce as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">{475}</a></span>
soon as they fancied it would be to their interest to
do so. 'It is a sham peace,' they said.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_695" id="Ref_695" href="#Foot_695">[695]</a></span>
But nothing could console certain of the monks. 'Alas!' they
muttered in their convents, 'the christians would
easily have discomfited and reduced the heretics to
subjection, and now these wicked ones will gain the
supremacy in the city.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_696" id="Ref_696" href="#Foot_696">[696]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=PROJECT OF RECONCILIATION.=</p>

<p>On the following day (29th March) the council of
sixty assembled 'to settle the strife of the day before.'
The tempest was not yet entirely appeased; the
catholic members of the council looked with threatening
eyes on the most notable of their colleagues, Jean
Philippe, François Faure, Claude Roset, and others.
These were the men to be attacked, they thought, for
the strength of the anticlerical movement lay with
them. But for a time, reconciliation was all the
fashion. They resolved to frame a compromise
which would satisfy both parties; and some of the
magistrates and principal citizens met to arrange a
system for uniting Rome and the Gospel.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_697" id="Ref_697" href="#Foot_697">[697]</a></span></p>

<p>The Two Hundred, who were joined by many other
citizens, being assembled on the 30th March, the
premier-syndic first liberated the hostages and then
proposed the famous project of reconciliation. The
council having accepted it, he forwarded a copy to
the captains of each company; and turning to the
Abbot of Bonmont, who pretty regularly discharged
the functions of bishop, considering the prelate's continual
absence, the chief magistrate said to him:
'Mr. Vicar, I shall give you also a copy of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">{476}</a></span>
decree, in order that you may take care to make your
priests live properly.' All the laymen agreed that
there lay the main difficulty. The sitting broke up.</p>

<p>Each company was immediately drawn up on its
Place d'Armes; the captain stood in the centre:
huguenots and mamelukes listened to this strange
decree which, regulating a religious matter, was
ordered by the civil authority and proclaimed by the
soldiers.</p>

<p class="side">=ARTICLES OF PEACE.=</p>

<p>'In the name of God, the Creator and Redeemer,
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,' read the captain, and
all bared their heads. 'In the interest of peace, it is
resolved,' continued the officer with sonorous voice,
'that all anger, grudges, injuries, and ill-will between
any soever of our citizens and inhabitants, as well
ecclesiastic as secular, and also all battery, insult, and
reproach, committed by one side or the other, be
wholly pardoned.'</p>

<p>The listeners appeared satisfied.</p>

<p>'<i>Item.</i> That every citizen, of what state or condition
soever he may be, live henceforward in peace,
without attempting any novelty until it be generally
<i>ordered to live otherwise</i>.'—'Really, here is a reform,'
said the huguenots, 'but it is in the future.'</p>

<p>'<i>Item.</i> That no one speak against the holy Sacraments,
and that in this respect every one be <i>left at
liberty according to his conscience</i>.'</p>

<p>Liberty and conscience! what strange words. If
the people of Geneva gained that, everything was
gained.</p>

<p>'That no one,' continued the captain, 'preach without
the license of the superior, the syndics, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">{477}</a></span>
council; and that <i>the preacher say nothing that is not
proved by Holy Scripture</i>.'</p>

<p>No article caused greater satisfaction. 'Good,'
said some of the reformed, 'our doctrine is that of
Holy Scripture.'—'Good,' said some of the catholics,
'the superior will contrive that no heretic preaches.'</p>

<p>The captain added the prohibition to eat meat on
Friday, to sing songs against one another, or to say
'You are a Lutheran,' 'You are a papist.' Moreover
he ordered the heads of families to inform their
wives and children of the decree. The catholic ladies
and their boys had been sufficiently forward at the
time of the battle not to be forgotten.</p>

<p>The captain having finished said to his company:
'Let those who desire peace and love hold up their
hands and make oath before God.'</p>

<p>The reformers, who obtained Holy Scripture and
liberty of conscience, held up their hands. The
catholics seeing that the episcopal authority and fast
days were left them, did the same; but in one of the
companies, a huguenot who did not care for this
mixture, said: 'I refuse!'—'To the Rhone with him,'
exclaimed the catholics immediately; 'to the Rhone.
Throw him into the Rhone without mercy, like a mad dog.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_698" id="Ref_698" href="#Foot_698">[698]</a></span>
Nobody, however, was drowned, and
next day there was a general procession through the
city to return thanks to God for the peace.</p>

<p>The catholics triumphed. Religious liberty and
the Bible seemed such strange things that they had
nothing to fear from them. They learnt the contrary
afterwards; but at this time the words looked like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">{478}</a></span>
a decoy, that had no reality, merely intended to
attract and catch the huguenots. On Palm Sunday,
a very learned dominican (as it was said) come from
Auxerre, was commissioned to preach the victory of
Rome. The crowd was so great that the convent
church could not contain it. He was conducted to
the open space in front of the building, where he got
up into a pulpit that had been brought out for him.
Standing proudly before his congregation, the disciple
of St. Dominic said: 'Here I am ready to enter into
the lists with these preachers. Let my lords of Berne
send as many as they like, I will undertake to confound
them all.' He had a copious flow of 'big
words, to the great contempt of the Word of God.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_699" id="Ref_699" href="#Foot_699">[699]</a></span>
The huguenots, scarcely able to contain themselves,
exclaimed: 'These canting knaves desire to blindfold
the eyes of the simple, so that they may not see the
sun which has risen on us in his brightness.'</p>

<p>The dominican continued hurling his thunderbolts
without intermission, then suddenly the assembly
became disturbed. The women screamed, the men
were agitated ... it was believed that the huguenots
were sallying from the city (for the convent was in a
suburb) and about to fall on the congregation. 'Shut
the gates' (of the city), cried some; and the devout
were still more frightened at this exclamation. Some
drew their swords, others their daggers, all got ready
to defend themselves. The poor monk, fancying the
Lutherans were there already and about to put him
to death, grew frightened, turned pale ... 'and fell
out of the pulpit in a faint.' But no huguenots
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">{479}</a></span>
appeared. The congregation began to enquire into
the cause of the alarm, and discovered a young hare
which had been let loose among the people, and was
running here and there between the women's dresses.
It was a trick played by some foolish jester. There
was a good deal of laughter in the city at the intrepid
champions of Rome who had so heroically drawn
their daggers against a leveret.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_700" id="Ref_700" href="#Foot_700">[700]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE LORD'S SUPPER.=</p>

<p>A ceremony of another kind, more serious and
absorbing, was in preparation. It was Passion-week,
and the evangelicals felt the necessity of meeting
in a spirit of christian fraternity around the
Lord's table. On Holy Thursday (10th April) fourscore
men and several women assembled in the garden
at the Pré l'Evêque. First, one of them washed
the feet of the others, in remembrance of the like act
done by our Lord. It was not an idle imitation with
them: they understood Christ's meaning: 'reminding
them that no one should refuse to descend to serve
his brethren and equals, however low and abject the
service might be;' and they felt that 'if charity is
abandoned, it is because every one takes more than
he wants, and despises almost all the others.' After
the washing of the feet, the holy sacrament was celebrated.
These energetic men humbled themselves
like little children before God, and approaching the
table in sincere faith, many experienced that the
presence of the Redeemer, although spiritual, is real
and strengthens the inner man.</p>

<p>As soon as the news of this celebration became
known, all the city spoke of it, and sarcasms were not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">{480}</a></span>
spared. 'These <i>Jews</i>,' they said, 'have bitten one
after another into a slice of bread and cheese, in token
of peace and union.... And thereupon the catholics
laughed,' sister Jeanne informs us.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_701" id="Ref_701" href="#Foot_701">[701]</a></span></p>

<p>But the laughter was soon changed into fear.
As they returned from the Pré l'Evêque, several
huguenots (and some of the most dreaded were
among them) walked through the streets together.
A few silly gossips having caught sight of them in
the distance, reported everywhere that large bodies
of heretics were assembling in the squares and plotting
to prevent the celebration of the mass on Easter
Sunday. It being Holy Thursday, the communion
was about to be administered in the churches; but
the women, terrified by the tales they heard, did not
dare stir out. The men grasped their arms; the
priests and monks did the same; and both pastors
and flocks began to celebrate the supper of peace,
protected by breastplates, daggers, and clubs. All
of them kept their ears on the watch; they were
agitated at the least noise; but no one came to
disturb them, and the communion passed off quietly.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_702" id="Ref_702" href="#Foot_702">[702]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=CONVENIENT INTERPRETATIONS.=</p>

<p>'It will be on Good-Friday then,' said a few of the
catholics; 'the huguenots, it is well known, are preparing
to make a demonstration that day in the Dominicans'
church, where the monk of Auxerre is to
preach.' To prevent such a mishap it was decided
that the good father should preach at St. Pierre's, 'the
like of which had never been seen within the memory
of man, on such a day.' The canons believed themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">{481}</a></span>
safe in their cathedral, as in a fortress. For
more security numerous bodies of men patrolled the
city; one of the chief catholics, M. de Thorens, paraded
proudly up and down surrounded by a troop
of bravoes. On Friday morning, priests and worshippers
went armed to St. Pierre's. Some of the
reformed were astonished at seeing them under arms on
such a day, and reminded them of our Lord's words:
<i>Put up thy sword in his sheath</i>. That means, said the
priests, 'that it must be kept close <i>until it is time to
draw it</i>.' Convenient interpretations are always to be
found.</p>

<p>These good people were disquieted without a cause:
there was not the least disturbance, and the preacher
of Auxerre said whatever he pleased.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_703" id="Ref_703" href="#Foot_703">[703]</a></span>
But he did not
feel at ease in the city of the huguenots, and Easter
Day was no sooner past than he returned 'hastily into
his own country.' No one dared preach after his departure,
which greatly surprised devout catholics.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_704" id="Ref_704" href="#Foot_704">[704]</a></span></p>

<p>The ordinance of the council had forwarded religious
liberty in Geneva, but it was little more than in theory;
the practice was more difficult. In the opinion of some,
Geneva ought to be entirely reformed; in the opinion
of others, entirely catholic: men of decision asked 'how
long they would halt between two opinions?' and
daring partisans repeated that the sword alone could
cut the difficult knot. The premier-syndic, Nicholas
du Crest, and councillor Roy started for Berne to
pray the senate not to support the Reform; while the
evangelicals, on the other hand, desired that it should
be allowed to develope itself freely. Many had a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">{482}</a></span>
fervour of mind, a sincere hunger and thirst for
righteousness; their souls sought after eternal salvation;
and they were as ambitious of heavenly truth as
conquerors are of glory and empire. The clergy, by
depriving them of their ministers, had reduced them
to simple attempts at mutual edification; but they desired
the full preaching of the Gospel, without which the
Church pines away. 'We are suffering from want,' they
said; 'we are deprived of our rights. A bold monk is
perpetually shouting that he is prepared to confound all
the ministers that Berne is willing to send us....
Well then, let us ask Berne for ministers whose learning
and eloquence may reduce these insolent and
prating Dominicans to silence.'</p>

<p class="side">=EMBASSY TO BERNE.=</p>

<p>The journey of Syndic du Crest disquieted Maisonneuve.
Who can tell but the respect due to the
chief magistrate of the republic may induce the powerful
canton of Berne to take a false step?...
He will endeavour to prevent so great a misfortune.
He communicated his intentions to the faithful
Salomon, who being full of confidence in his friend,
departed with him immediately on this perilous
journey.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_705" id="Ref_705" href="#Foot_705">[705]</a></span></p>

<p>Du Crest and Councillor Roy, arriving at Berne on
the 6th April, fancied one day they saw Maisonneuve
and Salomon in the street. They stopped in surprise,
eyed them both from head to foot, and looked as if
petrified.... It was really the two huguenots. The
premier-syndic was exasperated, and going up to
them, asked rudely, 'What are you doing here?'
'We are told that you have instructions to speak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">{483}</a></span>
against us,' answered Maisonneuve: 'we are here to
defend ourselves.' The next day, when the two
magistrates went to the council, they were still more
surprised to find the two reformed leaders in the outer
hall. They hoped at least to enter the council-room
alone; but no! the door was hardly open when the
two huguenots went forward unceremoniously with the
two magistrates, and sat down quietly at their left.
Was there then a second power in Geneva, which also
sent its ambassadors?</p>

<p>Maisonneuve was in reality an ambassador; his heart
burnt for a great cause—that of the Gospel and of the
new times. The truth which he represented filled
him with courage: he rose first, even before the Genevan
magistrate had spoken, and said with holy boldness:
'Most honoured lords, we and a great number
of our fellow-citizens desire the pure Word of God
to be preached in Geneva. The voice of the Gospel,
so little heard in times of yore, is now resounding
throughout Christendom, and we do not wish to give
up hearing it. Neither banishment nor threats can
reduce us to carelessness and inactivity.' And then
without fearing the premier-syndic, who was listening,
he continued: 'My lords, do you know to what extremity
we are reduced? Our magistrates are making
war upon us, and trying to drive from Geneva that
Gospel which you have established in Berne. After
the visit we paid you recently, they summoned us
before them.... And this Nicholas du Crest here
present has trampled our liberties under foot and
spoken to us as if we were thieves.... Instead of
answering your letters they went from house to house
exhorting their partisans to take up arms. They rang
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">{484}</a></span>
the tocsin; gathered together the canons, priests, and
common people; and contrived a wicked and bloody
conspiracy.... And why, my lords? We must
(they said) cut off the heads of those who went to
Berne.... Behold, most honoured lords, the value
they attach to your citizenship!... O liberties of
Geneva! O alliance of the League! O justice of the
laws!... Everything is trodden under foot by
priests determined to leave us for our inheritance
nothing but slavery and superstition, tears, sighs, and
groans.... A remedy must be applied, and you
alone can do it, most honoured lords. A fanatical
monk, who preaches against pure religion, has offered
to enter the lists against every minister of the Gospel
you may send us.... Do what he asks....
Grant to us and our brethren one of your preachers.
Obtain for him a public place where he may freely
declare the Word of God. Let him combat with this
dominican in a properly regulated discussion, and thus
ensure the triumph of the Gospel.'</p>

<p>Maisonneuve knew the risk he incurred by speaking
with so much frankness, and he therefore added:
'Perhaps you will also see that this just request does
not prevent our returning home and living there in
peace.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_706" id="Ref_706" href="#Foot_706">[706]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE ENVOY'S DISCOMFITURE.=</p>

<p>The syndic and the Genevan councillor, who had
not expected such a speech, were embarrassed. Having
come as accusers, they found themselves accused. The
angry looks of the Bernese councillors disturbed the
magistrate of Geneva still more than the words of the
protestant ambassador. The avoyer, turning to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">{485}</a></span>
syndic, asked him whether he had any answer to
make. 'We have no orders on the subject, and, therefore,
have nothing to say,' was his reply. 'Well
then,' said the lords of Berne, 'we will send a deputation
to Geneva shortly, to see what is going on
there with regard to religion.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_707" id="Ref_707" href="#Foot_707">[707]</a></span></p>

<p>The council rose. It seemed as if a favourable
wind was about to blow on the evangelical ship. But
a storm was preparing, which might perhaps dash it
to pieces.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Reformation of Geneva numbered in its ranks
the friends, not only of evangelical truth, but
of political liberty. There was both good and evil
in this. The vigorous hand of the huguenots may
possibly have been necessary to restrain the intrepid
mamelukes; but it was to be regretted that the arms
of the flesh shone beside those of the spirit. If reasoning
by syllogism is bad in religious subjects, reasoning
by the pike is worse still. Some partisans of the
Reform gave a new version of the <i>Compel them to
come in</i> of the Romish Church, by practising a little
of the <i>Compel them to go out</i>. Both of them need a
little indulgence. The human mind having been kept
in darkness for ten centuries, required a lengthened
education before it could understand that it is unholy
to employ in religion any other weapons than those
of free conviction.</p>

<p class="side">=WAR OF THE TONGUE.=</p>

<p>There was another kind of hostility, pretty frequent
in those times, and more conformable to the
manner of our days than swords and guns—the
use of ridicule. The Genevans of both schools
usually began with legitimate discussions, the catholics
alleging the infallibility of the pope, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">{487}</a></span>
reformed opposing them with that of the Word of
God. They debated on this subject in the streets and
in the convents, around the fire and even in the council.
But they often passed from discussion to ridicule.
One day, when the priests were walking in procession
and singing aloud the prayers for the conversion of
heretics, some huguenots, standing at the corner of a
street, fancying a resemblance between their harsh
chants and the voice of a certain thick-skinned animal,
said laughingly to one another: 'Give some thistles
to those noisy braying donkeys.' 'Alas!' exclaimed
the nuns in their cloister, 'they make so many jests
that you could not write them down in a year!' It
is Sister Jeanne who records this fact, but her narrative
is so full of fables that we cannot guarantee
its authenticity.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_708" id="Ref_708" href="#Foot_708">[708]</a></span></p>

<p>Most of the priests were stronger in arm than in
mind, and preferred a fight with swords to one with
words. That devout canon and valiant knight Messire
Pierre Wernli was bursting with rage. He harangued
in the convents, in private houses, and even in the
streets; he wished to fight and prove, halberd in
hand, that supreme respect was due to the papacy.
He held frequent conferences with the heads of the
party, both lay and ecclesiastic, at Percival de Pesmes',
at M. de Thorens', or at the vicar-episcopal's. All kept
their eyes and ears open, determined to take advantage
of the first opportunity to secure the triumph of their
cause. They thought the time for action had come
at last.</p>

<p>It was now the beginning of May, the date of the
fair at Lyons, at that time much frequented by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">{488}</a></span>
Genevans. Some of the principal huguenots hesitated,
however, to go there. It seemed difficult for them to
leave Geneva just at that moment, for all the indications
of a storm were visible in the sky. They
believed, however, they should have time to make
the little journey before the crisis arrived. Some of
the more daring among them posted up bills with
the words: 'Let us go to the fair before the war
and deliverance of Geneva.' They departed, and in
certain secret meetings it was said that the huguenots
who remained behind ought to be killed, and the gates
shut against those who were away: thus the religion
of Geneva would be saved. But in the opinion of
others, it was proper that the pomps of religious
worship should form a prelude to these combats of
the faith.</p>

<p class="side">=HIGH MASS.=</p>

<p>Sunday, the 4th of May, was the feast of the Holy
Windingsheet. The linen cloth, in which the body of
Jesus Christ was buried, and on which (it was said)
the print of his face had remained, was exhibited that
day in Geneva, and on other days in ten or twelve
different cities which all pretended to possess it.
At the moment when the Reform was endeavouring
to restore Christ's true image to the Church, such as it
is found in Holy Scripture, the most ardent partisans
of catholicism were found exhibiting on a sheet the
features, which sixteen centuries, as they alleged, had
not been able to efface. To give more importance to
the feast, the vicar-general entrusted the service to
Pierre Wernli, who was looked upon as one of the
most important of the canons, and was at the head
of the most bellicose. The congregation was large.
Great fervour, internal emotion, and ardent prayers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">{489}</a></span>
rendered the service that day more than usually solemn.
Wernli, who had put on his finest sacerdotal
robes, presided over the ceremony with religious enthusiasm
and swelling pride. He was fanatical but
sincere. His motto was: 'Everything for the honour
of God and holy Church.' Convinced of the efficacy
of the sacrifice of the mass, he repeated the <i>introit</i>,
chanted the offertory, consecrated the host, and went
through the elevation. The sympathetic accents that
rose from his heart resounded through the arches of
the cathedral. 'What a fine voice!' said some; 'what
a fine man! There is not such another officiater in
the world, and we have not seen so fine a service in
Geneva for these ten years!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_709" id="Ref_709" href="#Foot_709">[709]</a></span>
After the mass of the
Holy Windingsheet, the catholics could not doubt of
the approaching triumph of the Church.</p>

<p>A new contest was about to begin. We do not
forget the small extent of the field of battle. We
are not describing the destinies of the empire of the
Persians or the Romans, of the Russians or the
Germans; but those of a little city, surrounded by
a narrow territory. Here, everything is on a small
scale; yet the combat of which we are about to
speak led to the return of the prince-bishop; and if
the plans formed between that ecclesiastical prince,
the duke of Savoy, and the emperor himself had been
carried into execution at that moment, as everything
seemed to forebode, liberty and the Reformation
would have perished in Geneva. Would that loss
have produced no effect? Are we mistaken in thinking
that the great battle which was to last during all
the 16th century—a battle which the Gospel and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">{490}</a></span>
liberty fought against Rome, Jesuitism, and the Inquisition,
and which is undoubtedly the most important
of modern times—might not have had the same
issue, if this little city, so full of living faith and
heroic courage, had not fought in the ranks, and
imparted to protestantism the vigour necessary to
conquer formidable enemies? When they hear of
these petty struggles, many of the friends of liberty
and the Gospel perhaps may say: 'Let us not
despise such little things. It is we whom the narrative
concerns. These people were the first to fight
for the precious gifts which we now enjoy in peace.'</p>

<p>Wernli did not intend to remain satisfied with a
mass: he believed a fight was necessary. He had
hardly laid aside his robes, his cross, and stole, when
he thought of donning his armour: this was part of
his piety. He had no trouble in persuading his
brethren, for the priests were more zealous than
the laymen in these disturbances.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_710" id="Ref_710" href="#Foot_710">[710]</a></span>
The first battle
having proved a failure, they prepared for a second.
In the Reformation of Geneva facts play as important
a part as ideas. The great questions of rights,
liberty, and truth were not elaborated simply in the
studies of a few lawyers or divines, but were discussed
around the hearths of burghers, at the meetings of
evangelicals, and in the general council of the citizens,
and were decided in the streets in the midst of formidable
struggles. Ideas became acts; doctrines
gave birth to events; theories set men's hearts beating,
armed their hands, and produced great deliverances.
There may have been some evil in this mighty
activity, but it was an unavoidable evil.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">{491}</a></span></p>

<p>On the afternoon of the festival, Wernli and a great
number of other ecclesiastics met in council at the
vicar-episcopal's. They bitterly regretted that the
good-nature of the Friburgers and the weakness of the
syndics had caused the failure of their plot. They
had lost the game, and must begin again. A project
adjourned needs not on that account be given up.
The catholics should take advantage of the time when
the absence of the principal huguenots would make
the victory easy.</p>

<p class="side">=A HOLIDAY EVENING.=</p>

<p>During this discussion a few citizens of both parties
were promenading near the Rhone, apparently thinking
only of taking a little recreation. It was the evening
of a holiday, and the setting sun poured its rays in
floods of flame upon the lake. The west was on fire,
the water reflected the image of the sky, and flashed
with bright and flickering colours. But the citizens
thought little at this moment of the beauties of nature.
However great the apparent calm without, their souls
were agitated by fierce passions. By degrees they
entered into conversation; they spoke of religion, as
was their custom; they debated with warmth, then
they began to dispute and to abuse each other, and
finally hands were raised and blows were struck.</p>

<p>The sun set; the brightness died away, all grew pale
round the city, and daylight was fading into darkness.
The hour, so favourable for walking, had attracted
many abroad; the noise drew still more. Huguenots
and mamelukes, catholics and reformed, hurried
to the Molard. 'What is the matter?' they asked.
The parties were already forming into two distinct
groups. Every one as he arrived joined his friends;
they arranged themselves in order, they soon counted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">{492}</a></span>
their numbers, and two bands drew up face to face.
Some of the more impetuous went in front and excited
the crowd. The gaoler of the episcopal prisons and
his brother, both great brawlers, who handled the
dagger cleverly, 'very riotous men' (says a manuscript)
thorough bravoes of the 16th century, were
among the most violent. Monks and priests of the
lower rank mingled with the people in the square,
while their superiors were in consultation at the vicar-episcopal's.
They excited the crowd, and complained
loudly that the Friburgers had hindered them on the
28th March from destroying the heretics, which, they
held, would have been a necessary severity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the two parties, though already face to
face, apparently did not think of coming to blows.
One Pinet, sent by the clergy 'to apply the match,
began to work upon the people.' He glided from
group to group, and strove to inflame the minds of
the catholics. 'Who will fight along with me on
behalf of his religion?' he said. Then turning
towards the huguenots, he challenged them, shouting
out, with an oath: 'Your creed is a rascally one, you
Lutherans! If there is a man among you willing to
maintain the contrary, let him come here and fight.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_711" id="Ref_711" href="#Foot_711">[711]</a></span>
This challenge was repeated several times, but the
reformed feared a disturbance. 'Peace has been made,'
said they, 'do not break it.' Some of them added:
'Be on your guard, Pinet is a sad scamp.' Nobody
would 'take the bait.' One huguenot, however,
the impatient Ami Perrin, could not contain himself;
provoked by the priests' agent, he rushed upon him
and nearly killed him. Both huguenots and catholics
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">{493}</a></span>
ran between them to separate them. Peace was
restored or at least seemed to be; but a spark had
been struck out, and the fire was about to be kindled.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_712" id="Ref_712" href="#Foot_712">[712]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=MARIN DE VERSONAY.=</p>

<p>A young Catholic, Marin de Versonay, agitated
by the scene which he had just witnessed, left the
square and hurried up the Rue du Perron. Versonay
was a man of narrow mind but ardent imagination,
and fanatically attached to the Romish Church, which
he looked upon as the sole and exclusive source of
holiness and everlasting happiness. Moreover he
had an unbounded affection for his cousin Percival
de Pesmes, and the profoundest respect for the
sovereignty of the bishop. His ancestors had conferred
great services upon Geneva. In 1476 his
grandfather Aymon, councillor to the bishop John
Louis of Savoy, had lent his plate to the city to quiet
the Swiss, who threatened it with pillage. The young
nobleman wished to do for Geneva more than his
grandfather had done—he wished to destroy heresy.
His wife, with whom the priests were great friends,
urged him on night and day.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_713" id="Ref_713" href="#Foot_713">[713]</a></span></p>

<p>The members of the episcopal council, the canons
and principal priests, were all armed and waiting at
Messire de Bonmont's house the issue of this skirmish.
At every noise they pricked up their ears,
fancying they heard the footsteps of a messenger;
but none appeared, and everything seemed to betoken
that peace would not be disturbed. Pinet had
withdrawn in confusion, and Perrin, notwithstanding
his natural impetuosity, knew very well that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">{494}</a></span>
reformed did not wish to take the initiative and break
the public peace. Tranquillity was restored. A few
citizens of both parties still remained in the Molard,
but many of the catholics and huguenots had left,
and to seal their concord had gone to drink together,
saying that they intended to remain friends. The
match had gone out.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_714" id="Ref_714" href="#Foot_714">[714]</a></span></p>

<p>Young de Versonay and the impetuous canon were
going to rekindle it. The former, whose imagination
had been excited, directed his steps to De Bonmont's
house. He knocked violently at the gate and shouted
aloud: 'Help! help! they are killing all good christians!'
At the sound of these imprudent words the
canons and priests caught fire; some remained
doubtful and motionless, but Pierre Wernli, 'that
good knight,' immediately sprang to his feet. The
service he had celebrated in the cathedral was hardly
over, when he had thought of another, and said to
himself that this very day the Reformation must be
buried in a winding-sheet from which it should never
rise again. Accordingly, after taking off his sacerdotal
robes, he had put on his breastplate and
cuishes, belted his sword to his side, seized his
heavy halberd, and thus armed,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_715" id="Ref_715" href="#Foot_715">[715]</a></span>
had gone to the
vicar-episcopal's. Immediately Wernli heard Versonay's
voice, he thought the hour was come. Standing
in the midst of the priests, and grasping his weapon,
he invited his colleagues by a glance to follow him.
Many hesitated, and then, 'burning with love of God,'
says one of his greatest admirers, 'this good champion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">{495}</a></span>
of the faith, seeing that nobody got ready for the
fight, lost patience, would not wait for the other
churchmen, and went out first with fiery courage.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_716" id="Ref_716" href="#Foot_716">[716]</a></span>
The die was cast; the battle was about to begin, for
no one was able to stop the impetuous canon.</p>

<p class="side">=THE TOCSIN SOUNDS.=</p>

<p>However, three other priests, less notable but
quite as violent—Bertholet, Manillier, and Servant—ran
to St. Pierre's and ordered the ringers to sound
the tocsin loudly and hurriedly. These men, themselves
alarmed at what was told them about the riot,
rang immediately, 'to the great terror of Christians,'
says sister Jeanne. Over all the city swelled the
majestic voice of <i>Clemence</i>, an ancient bell, well
known at Geneva, which bears this inscription on
the rim:</p>

<p class="center small">EGO VOCOR CLEMENTIA.<br />
AVE MARIA, GRATIA PLENA.<br />
PLEBEM VOCO, CONVOCO CLERUM,<br />
VOX MEA CUNCTORUM<br />
FIT TERROR DEMONIORUM.</p>

<p>In truth Clemence at this moment 'was calling
the people and convoking the clergy,' and as
for the 'demons, whom her voice was to affright,'
... they were the reformed—at least in the eyes
of the priests. The huguenots who remained in the
Molard, thought that the papists meditated returning
to the attack and killing them in their houses. The
darkness increased the agitation caused by the dismal
sounds from the belfry. 'What is the matter?' said
the citizens. 'The heretics are assembling in the
principal square to plunder the churches,' answered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">{496}</a></span>
some of the catholics. 'Let us rally on the other
side, in front of the stalls,' was the reply. Some said
truly that it was a false alarm; that the huguenots
had gone to the river bank simply for a walk, as is
everywhere customary on a Sunday evening, and that
they were already returning home; but the more
violent would listen to nothing; they hurried from
all quarters, summoned by the tocsin, and displayed
their banners. On the side of the stalls they shouted
with all their might: 'Rally here, all Christians, and
be of good heart in defence of holy faith.' And
great was the tumult among them. It was quite
pitiful to hear their cries in the streets.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_717" id="Ref_717" href="#Foot_717">[717]</a></span>
The other churchmen, who at the first moment had hesitated to
follow the canon, took courage, and leaving the
vicar's house, descended to the Molard.</p>

<p>In the priests' eyes it was a decisive moment. A
great number of them, no doubt, thought only of
their personal interests, but many believed that the
issue of the struggle was a question of life or death
for catholicism in Geneva. They shuddered when
they saw those whom they termed unnatural children,
turning away from the bosom of their mother's breast—the
papacy. 'These curious and rebellious minds,'
they said, 'imagine that they will overthrow the
Church ... but the gates of hell shall not prevail
against it.... O bride of Christ! thou who procurest
for us the chaste and everlasting embraces
(<i>castos æternosque amplexus</i>) of the divine Spouse,
we are thine for ever!'</p>

<p class="side">=WERNLI'S APPEAL.=</p>

<p>Wernli had made up his mind to give his life, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">{497}</a></span>
necessary, for the cause of Rome. This was not
with him the hasty resolution of a moment. Seeing
the progress of the Reformation, he had vowed to
sacrifice everything for its destruction, and it was
with this intention he now descended from the neighbourhood
of St. Pierre's to the Molard. It was
necessary to accomplish on the 4th May what the
28th March had been unable to do. 'Wernli desired
to be the first,' says Froment, 'to support as a man
of war the holy mother Church.' He was both the
hero and the victim of this important day. Vainly
did the people shout to him on every side that 'Peace
was made;' ... he would hear nothing. 'He was
the most obstinate and the maddest of the priests.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_718" id="Ref_718" href="#Foot_718">[718]</a></span>
Full of venom and devotion for the cause of popery,
he exclaimed: 'Ho! all good christians to my aid.'
Many laymen and clerks joined him, and they proceeded
hurriedly towards the square. 'The canons
and other churchmen were the first under the flag,'
says Sister Jeanne. In a short time fifteen hundred
men, 'many of them priests,' were assembled.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_719" id="Ref_719" href="#Foot_719">[719]</a></span></p>

<p>During this time, other ecclesiastics were gathering
in arms in the court of St. Pierre, so as to stop the
huguenots who might desire to go to the scene of the
tumult. Three reformers, coming from the Bourg
du Four, soon arrived with hasty steps in front of the
cathedral. The sacerdotal corps immediately barred
the way, and the priests began to attack them. One
of them was 'unfortunate enough to receive <i>twenty-eight</i>
wounds at their hands, and fell to the ground.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">{498}</a></span>
As for the other two, 'the dogs took flight,' says the
bulletin of St. Claire.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_720" id="Ref_720" href="#Foot_720">[720]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=WERNLI HEADS THE FIGHT.=</p>

<p>At this moment Wernli and his followers reached
the Molard. The night was dark, the stars above
gave a faint light; men appeared like shadows, and
it was hard to distinguish friends from foes. Obscure
and confused noises, inarticulate sounds, marks of
approbation or of anger, issued from the darkness.
It was like the hoarse roaring of the sea before the
storm bursts forth. For a few seconds there was a
dead silence, then on a sudden loud shouting. When
the canon arrived, armed from head to foot, he
heard the cries of the reformers, and, stirred with
anger, he flourished his halberd, and pointing it in
their direction, shouted out in his Friburg patois:
'Dear God! where are these Lutherans who speak ill
of our law?... God's blood! where are they?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_721" id="Ref_721" href="#Foot_721">[721]</a></span>
With a coarse oath, he turned round to his followers,
and said, 'Courage, good christians! do not
spare those rascals.' One might fancy him the giant
Goliath, who, with a helmet of brass upon his head,
and armed with a coat of mail, came forth, spear in
hand, to defy the army of Israel.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_722" id="Ref_722" href="#Foot_722">[722]</a></span></p>

<p>The warlike canon had hardly given the signal
when the combat began. It was a fine spring night,
everything was pale and grey; it was, as we have
said, easy to make mistakes; the silence and obscurity
imparted a certain solemnity to the struggle. The
shadows moving about the Molard became agitated;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">{499}</a></span>
they rushed upon each other, and dealt frequent
blows in the darkness. One shadow ran after another,
but on both sides they fought desperately and at
close quarters. From time to time there was a brief
gleam; sword met sword, and flashed fire. The
violent Perrin and the zealous Claude Bernard
were at the head of the huguenots, and struck stoutly.
Among the catholics, John Rosetti and Canon Viole
were those who rushed with greatest fury upon their
adversaries. All four fell wounded on the spot.
Others besides them were hit, and their blood
flowed; but they were not noticed, and the combatants
trampled the wounded under foot, until their
friends, recognising them, carried them to some
neighbouring house. A blow more famous than all
was about to be struck; a victim more notable was
about to bite the dust.</p>

<p>Wernli, who had remained at the top of the square,
unable to see his enemies, was challenging them with
all the strength of his lungs. 'Where are they?' he
kept on shouting and swearing; 'Where are these
Lutherans who speak ill of our law?' Some huguenots
who were not in the square, but in the Rue de
la Croix d'Or (all the adjoining streets were full of
catholics and reformers), answered him, 'They are
here.' The canon, who could not see, but who could
hear, rushed halberd in hand in the direction whence
the reply came. He reached his enemies, striking
them with the head and the butt of his weapon,
which he handled as easily as his breviary. By
killing Lutherans he hoped to kill Lutheranism itself.</p>

<p>The huguenots whom he had attacked did not
remain idle, but parried the priest's blows with their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">{500}</a></span>
naked swords. At last one of them, whom the long
and pointed blade provoked, sprang forward, caught
hold of the halberd, broke it in two and flung the
pieces away. The hero of the clergy, finding himself
deprived of his favourite weapon, lost not a
moment; he drew his two-handed sword and rushed
upon his adversaries, cutting and thrusting like a
Switzer of Grandson. The huguenots, finding themselves
so vigorously attacked, no longer stood upon
the defensive; they fell upon the champion of the
papacy. 'They charged him,' says Sister Jeanne,
who adds, 'but he defended himself valiantly.' His
breastplate protected his body from the neck to the
waist, so that all the blows aimed at him glanced off,
'so completely and cunningly was he armed.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_723" id="Ref_723" href="#Foot_723">[723]</a></span>
At last a man named Pierre l'Hoste, as is believed, a poor
carman, impatient at the long struggle, looking upon
Wernli as a soldier and not a priest, approached him,
and, moving round him in search of the weak point
in his armour, plunged his sword into his body. The
canon staggered and fell. 'Thus was the blasphemer
killed, and he lay in the square without moving hand or foot.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_724" id="Ref_724" href="#Foot_724">[724]</a></span>
The struggle occurred in front of the
house of Councillor Chautemps, one of the most
zealous of the evangelicals. Wernli fell on the steps.
<i>They that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_725" id="Ref_725" href="#Foot_725">[725]</a></span>
Some priests who were near, seeing their captain fall,
fled each to his convent or to the cloister of St.
Pierre.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_726" id="Ref_726" href="#Foot_726">[726]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=DEATH OF THE CANON.=</p>

<p>The death of the general did not, however, put an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">{501}</a></span>
end to the fight. Priests with their partisans, and
huguenots, were still exchanging blows when the
syndic of the guard, the head of the military department,
arrived. He raised his official bâton and ordered
the citizens to return to their houses. De Chapeaurouge,
commander of the cavalry, zealously assisted
him. 'Stop!' they both exclaimed. All their calling
was useless, so great was the popular emotion, and
so inflamed was their courage, says the chronicle.
The syndic, advancing into the midst of the combatants,
conjured them to separate; but he received a
blow on the head from the hands of a priest.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_727" id="Ref_727" href="#Foot_727">[727]</a></span>
What the canon's death had not been able to do, the magistrate's
wound accomplished. This incident put an
end to the contest. The reformed, full of respect for
the syndic, sheathed their swords and withdrew to
their homes.</p>

<p>Some priests, however, with a few of their partisans,
refused to obey. They were unwilling to fail this
time, and did not intend that their project should
come to nothing. They were determined to bury the
Reform. Exasperated bands paraded the streets,
challenging and insulting the huguenots, who refused
to chastise the braggart priests. Even this forbearance
did not appease the fanatics; they continued
their provocations until daybreak. 'All night the
christians were under arms,' says Sister Jeanne,
'seeking those wicked dogs; but it was of no good,
for they were all hidden!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_728" id="Ref_728" href="#Foot_728">[728]</a></span>
When daylight began to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">{502}</a></span>
appear, the clergy and their allies, fatigued with the
tumultuous night, went off to bed, and thus ended
their second attack. Now they will try to obtain by
intrigue and terror, what arms have failed to procure
them.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">THE CANON'S DEATH MADE A WEAPON AGAINST THE REFORM.<br />
 (<span class="smc">May to July 1533.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WERNLI'S death was to be fruitful in serious
consequences. The priests were about to show
what the violent death of an ecclesiastic might mean,
and the terrible consequences it carries with it. To
sacrifice the liberties of Geneva and the evangelical
Reformation on his tomb, was, in their opinion,
the only offering that could appease heaven.</p>

<p>Next morning at sunrise, a few citizens left their
houses and proceeded towards the field of battle.
They perceived a man, dressed like a warrior, lying
on the steps of a house; a great sword lay a few paces
off. They approached, stooped down and touched
him ... he was stark dead ... it was
the canon, Messire Pierre Wernli. His body had
lain all night in the street, unobserved by every one.
As Councillor Chautemps, a peaceable man, had remained
indoors, the body had not been perceived.
The cuirass bore the marks of the blows received by
the champion of the priests. His garments were
bloody and his features still wore a fierce look.
Those who gazed upon him were moved. A canon,
a chief of the Church, he who the day before had
officiated with so much state at St. Pierre's, surrounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">{504}</a></span>
by all the pomps of the service, had been
struck down by the huguenots ... and there he lay
dead. Some ran off to spread the news: 'Messire
Pierre lies bathed in blood near the Molard.' Canons
and priests, monks and mamelukes, and even the
huguenots, ran out and surrounded the dead body.
'All the city was troubled when they found the corpse.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_729" id="Ref_729" href="#Foot_729">[729]</a></span>
The devout knelt down, and striking their
breasts, exclaimed with tears: 'O blessed martyr,
sacrificed to God!' According to some good catholics,
he took his place in the ranks of the confessors
who, like Thomas à Becket, had been put to death
for honouring the holy Roman Church. This species
of canonisation disgusted the huguenots: 'What!'
they said, 'a priest fights with the halberd and sheds
the blood of citizens—he turns soldier, and you make
him a saint! Rather recognise in his death the just
judgment of God.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_730" id="Ref_730" href="#Foot_730">[730]</a></span>
At that moment, there came up
a woman of mean appearance, who fell shrieking
on the body. She pressed it in her arms, with
many sighs and groans. She was the canon's housekeeper,
they said; but the manuscript which records
this incident gives her a more significant name.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_731" id="Ref_731" href="#Foot_731">[731]</a></span></p>

<p>This death was a great event, and the members of
the council felt the liveliest apprehensions. Wernli
was not only a canon, but a Friburger, and belonged
to a powerful family. What would not be the wrath
of his fellow-citizens! 'Had we known of this murder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">{505}</a></span>
last evening,' said the mamelukes, 'the sword
would have taken vengeance on Messire Pierre's
assassins, and the night would have been a night of
terror and death.' Their rage would have been so
great that they would have entered every house and
made a general massacre. But the abler men of the
party made less noise, and thought of the advantage
they might derive from the catastrophe. The most
extreme measures now became legitimate, and the
canon's death was to result in the triumph of the
pope. Even now, a few catholics assembling round
the corpse, traded upon the scene, and uncovering
Wernli's wounds, pointed them out to the people,
and thus sought to arouse their anger. Others
succeeded in preventing the gates from being opened,
lest the huguenots who had crossed swords with the
canon should escape. When the reformed learnt
that the city was closed, although it was broad daylight,
they asked if it was intended to murder them,
and some immediately armed themselves and went to
Baudichon de la Maisonneuve's house.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_732" id="Ref_732" href="#Foot_732">[732]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=BURYING THE DEAD.=</p>

<p>About nine o'clock the body was lifted up and
carried into Chautemp's house, where it was placed
decently on a bed. The cuirass was taken off, the
stains of blood washed away; it was arrayed in the
priest's canonical robes, and the devout folks knelt
around it. Every moment other catholics, men and
women, took the places of those who left. The same
day, at five in the afternoon, an immense procession
descended from St. Pierre's to do honour to this
'blessed martyr.' The priests placed the canon on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">{506}</a></span>
showy bier, and when they came out of the house,
'the people uttered a loud cry.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_733" id="Ref_733" href="#Foot_733">[733]</a></span>
Some of the reformed
joined in the funeral train; all enmity (they
thought) should perish in the presence of the dead.
The body was taken into the cathedral, and buried at
the foot of the great crucifix. The council, wishing
to hold the balance even, imprisoned a few men who
passed for the most violent of both parties.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_734" id="Ref_734" href="#Foot_734">[734]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=WERNLI'S RELATIONS ARRIVE.=</p>

<p>Five days later, a herald from Friburg and many
of Wernli's relatives appeared in deep mourning, and
demanded that the body should be given up to them;
they also called for signal reparation. At five o'clock
the same day, the body was exhumed in the presence
of an immense crowd, and, wonder unheard-of! the
canon stood upright, and the blood flowed from his
wound as fresh as if he had been alive. 'Of a truth,'
said those in the cathedral, 'this is a miracle, a testimony
borne to the holy Roman faith, for the maintenance
of which his body was mangled. His blood
cries for revenge.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_735" id="Ref_735" href="#Foot_735">[735]</a></span></p>

<p>But the reformed said that popery is full of such
cheats (<i>piperies</i>) and idle dreams, opposed to common
sense, by means of which impostors deceive the
simple. They believed that when the Son of God
became man, many signs of divine power had accompanied
that great miracle; and that if the sun acts
upon the earth, and transforms a poor grain of wheat
into a magnificent ear of corn, it is very reasonable
to admit that he who created the sun exercises his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">{507}</a></span>
sovereign action here whenever he wills it, and effects
transformations still more marvellous; but they
would not suffer the tricks of men to be placed in
the same rank with the interventions of the supreme
power of the Creator. The miracle having been confirmed
by <i>eight hundred witnesses</i>, says Sister Jeanne,
the body was laid in a coffin and carried to the lake,
all the priests singing, while the women and some of
the devout made the air re-echo with their cries and
groans. The coffin was placed in a boat and taken
to Friburg.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_736" id="Ref_736" href="#Foot_736">[736]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE REFORM MUST BE CRUSHED.=</p>

<p>The priests thought the moment had now come for
getting rid of the evangelicals for ever. At first, the
reform had been a mere thread of water, but the
thread had suddenly increased, and become like an
Alpine torrent, which, if it were not checked, would
overthrow the altars and sweep away crosses, images
and holy water, priests and prelates. Had not an
illustrious canon been attacked and carried away by
this devastating flood? 'Now,' said the priests,
'must be accomplished what our Lord told the
apostles: He that hath no sword, let him sell his
garment and buy one. If we do not crush these
accursed Lutherans now, they will never cease to
trouble the churches, to plunder, beat and kill....
Let us sell everything, even our wallets, to procure
spears and swords.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_737" id="Ref_737" href="#Foot_737">[737]</a></span>
They set the example; they
never went out except well supplied with arms
under their frocks. The sisters of St. Claire and
all the devout women of Geneva exclaimed with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">{508}</a></span>
delight on seeing the clergy so resolved: 'Ah, if the
clerks were not so stout-hearted, these ravening
wolves would exterminate us.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_738" id="Ref_738" href="#Foot_738">[738]</a></span>
But the more reasonable
of the men saw that the clubs of the priests
would not suffice alone. 'The hour is come,' said
they at Geneva and Friburg, at Chambery, and
wherever Rome had faithful followers; 'the bishop
must return to Geneva, and resume his former
authority.' A deputation started from Friburg for
Arbois to entreat Pierre de la Baume to return to
his episcopal city.</p>

<p class="side">=THE BISHOP AT ARBOIS.=</p>

<p>Since the death of Besançon Hugues, the bishop
had taken no steps to recover his power. Wounded
by what had occurred in his principality, he kept his
vexation to himself, made up his mind to remain
quiet, and sought consolation at Arbois in good living.
'I have received your capons,' he wrote, 'send me
some fish. I have been enjoying myself, and am
much better supplied with provisions here than at
Geneva.' He was at heart neither wicked nor cruel;
he had taste, education, and talent, and his conversation
abounded in wit. But he had two passions—the
table and money, besides a weak and selfish
temper which made him incline one time to the
duke, another to Geneva, and appear servile or
tyrannical according as he hoped to obtain anything
by baseness or by despotism. The Genevans, and
particularly the huguenots, knew him well. 'He
wants to ride <i>one</i> and lead the <i>other</i>,' said Robert
Vandel, 'and does nothing except for his own advantage.'</p>

<p>When the Friburgers arrived at Arbois, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">{509}</a></span>
drew him from his stupid tranquillity, disturbed
his feasting, and firmly represented to him that they
wanted to know whether he desired to maintain
catholicism in Geneva, or to let it perish. They even
attacked him with personal arguments, which they
knew must have great force for him. 'Return to
your city, my lord,' they said, 'to recover your lost
authority, and protect your threatened rents.' But
La Baume was too timid, and would willingly have
lived anywhere except in his own diocese and principality.
He defended his absenteeism in a singular
manner. 'Many of these heretics have uttered great
threats against me,' he said; 'they will kill me like
poor Wernli.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_739" id="Ref_739" href="#Foot_739">[739]</a></span>
A mightier voice than that of Friburg
now made itself heard.</p>

<p>The condition of Geneva was known in all catholic
countries. Men were uneasy everywhere; even Pope
Clement VII. felt anxious. He did not admire those
ecclesiastics who, following the example of Leo X.,
neglected business for pleasure. In some places the
catholics imagined that if the Reform were crushed in
Geneva, the recoil would act on the Reformation in
general; that the other protestant nations would feel
its effects, and that such a defeat would be the beginning
of the end. Representations to this effect
reached the pope from every side, and he, being a
skilful politician and having the saving of the Roman
court at heart, wrote to the bishop: 'I command you
to proceed to Geneva immediately you receive this
bull, under pain of excommunication. Is it not
singular that you pass your life in a foreign province
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">{510}</a></span>
as if you were not the pastor of that city? You, by
your absence, are the cause of all the misfortunes
with which it is afflicted.... Go, speak, act ...
defend the flock which Jesus Christ and the holy see
have entrusted to you, and rescue your sheep from
the ravening wolf that is preparing to devour them.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_740" id="Ref_740" href="#Foot_740">[740]</a></span></p>

<p>The poor bishop, when he read the bull, was seized
with the most violent emotion. He saw himself between
two dangers almost equally great: the pope
who threatened him with excommunication, and the
huguenots who threatened him with death. What
was to be done? He was urged on both sides. At
last he formed an heroic decision and determined to
obey the pope. He will leave Arbois and the pleasant
life he had led there, with all its earthly advantages,
and go to that terrible city which appears to him
inhabited by wild beasts thirsting for his blood.
'Only you must obtain a safe-conduct for me from
Messieurs of Geneva,' he said to the Friburg ambassadors,
who were greatly surprised at having to
ask a safe-conduct for a prince who desired to visit
his principality, for a bishop who desired to enter
his diocese. However, they promised everything.</p>

<p class="side">=THE BISHOP INVITED TO RETURN.=</p>

<p>Wernli's death had not only enraged the enemies
of the Reformation, but had weakened its friends and
occasioned a reaction in Geneva favourable to catholicism.
The syndics and council now leant decidedly
that way, and the return of the bishop seemed to
them the only means of restoring order. 'The
bishop does not need a safe-conduct,' they said;
'only let him come. If anybody threatens him, we
will punish him so severely, that Monseigneur shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">{511}</a></span>
have cause to be satisfied.'—'Let him come back,
let him come back,' was the general cry except among
the pious evangelicals and the proud huguenots.
The emancipation had hardly begun, when a strong
counter-revolution threatened to stifle it. On the
26th May the council elected Domaine Franc, Stephen
d'Adda, and Bon Officher to go and humbly urge
their bishop and prince to return. Thus Geneva
herself was preparing to bury its Reformation and
its liberty.</p>

<p>Other Genevans had arrived at Arbois before the
deputies from the council. The principal mameluke
chiefs, whether banished or emigrant, who found the
bread of exile bitter, had started for Arbois as soon
as they had heard of the canon's death. Full of that
exasperation and agitated by those dreams which
self-exiled and banished men ordinarily have, they
endeavoured to make the bishop share their hopes
and hatred. 'Nothing is juster and easier,' they
said, 'than to put the leading huguenots into prison,
on suspicion of being concerned in the attack upon
Wernli. They will be executed, or if the people
oppose, they can be transported suddenly to some
castle in Savoy, as Lévrier was formerly, and then we
can do our pleasure on them. After that nothing
will be able to disturb the holy union of Geneva with
Savoy and the pope.' But Pierre de la Baume had
already recovered a little from the heroic resolution
he had formed after reading the papal brief. The
violent language of the mamelukes aroused all his
terrors. 'The Genevans,' he said, 'are proud, independent,
and fond of tumult; at the least word that
displeases them, they fly to arms. No ... afraid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">{512}</a></span>
as I am, I dare not go to Geneva.' 'Do not fear, we
will accompany you,' answered the mamelukes. 'The
Friburgers on their part will provide you with a
guard; the Genevan catholics, who are ten to one,
will do the same; the duke is resolved to support
you.... It is impossible that we should not crush
the rebels.' The calculation was correct and the
argument unanswerable. Pierre de la Baume, finding
himself summoned by the pope, and surrounded
with spears and spearmen, horses and chariots, again
resumed an heroic courage, and almost made up his
mind to appear in the city of the huguenots.</p>

<p>Just at this moment the Genevan deputies arrived,
and the bishop-prince showed at first a
very courteous humour, and replied with an amiable
air that he would return to Geneva <i>in a month</i>.
Always uneasy, he still tried to procrastinate. So
many things may happen in a month—perhaps,
finally, he may never return to his episcopal city.
'I regard you as my well-beloved subjects,' he said,
'and desire to appear as your true and good prince.'
Stephen d'Adda, a decided member of the opposition,
placed but little trust in these fine words. In reality
they were playing a little comedy at the priory of
Arbois: the bishop was afraid to go, and one or two
of the deputies preferred that he should not come.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_741" id="Ref_741" href="#Foot_741">[741]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=A COUP D'ÉTAT NECESSARY.=</p>

<p>Will he go or not? No one could tell. There
were certain moments when La Baume felt inclined
to cross the Jura, and then all of a sudden he felt as
if <i>nailed</i> to his priory of Arbois. Never was it more
difficult to arrive at a decision—it was like a nightmare.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">{513}</a></span>
His friends began to deliberate; they quite
agreed with him that if he desired simply to re-establish
his residence in the episcopal city, it would be
better for him not to go there at all. He would
always have to begin again with the independence of
the huguenots and the heresy of the reformed, with
alarms and riots. The evil would even be worse
than before, for the cause of liberty and reform had
made great progress since the bishop had left Geneva.
He is compelled, therefore, to gain two victories if
he returns: first, he must trample under foot the
franchises of the people and get rid of the huguenots;
and, second, he must silence the evangelical
teaching and expel the reformers and their adherents.
The prince-bishop and his imprudent advisers were
convinced that a <i>coup d'état</i>, and (if we may use the
term) a <i>coup d'église</i>, were the only remedies for the
critical and almost desperate position of affairs.
Geneva was to go back to the superstitions and
servility of the middle ages. It was necessary to
extinguish the double torch of political independence
and christian truth which a divine hand had kindled,
and so put Christendom beyond the reach of
these treacherous lights. But the timid La Baume
shrank with alarm from such a herculean task; he
knew his own weakness, and felt the enterprise would
be too arduous for him.</p>

<p>Meantime the Friburg ambassadors in Geneva
were preparing the way for him. They demanded
aloud, what he proposed to do in secret. Being admitted
to the Council on the 23rd May, they said:
'We accuse all who were in the Molard at the time
of Wernli's death, including the syndic of the guard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">{514}</a></span>
and the commander of the cavalry.' They spoke
haughtily, and required immediate satisfaction. A
whole section of the population—the most innocent
in this affair, even the party which had been attacked—was
to be criminally prosecuted! It was a monstrous
demand. However, the Friburgers spoke loud,
and many of the huguenots were dejected. The
Council, being divided and intimidated, made answer
at last that they would authorise the lieutenant
and the procurator-fiscal 'to arrest all whom Messieurs
of Friburg accused.' Thus the plot was in a
fair way: liberty and Reform had, however, a moment's
respite.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_742" id="Ref_742" href="#Foot_742">[742]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=DECLARATION OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.=</p>

<p>Two ambassadors from Berne, Councillor Sebastian
de Diesbach and Banneret John de Weingarten,
arrived at Geneva, and had conferences with the men
of both parties. Their ideas gradually became clearer,
and truth sprang out of the conflict of opinions.
They saw that this position of affairs, which seemed
an inextricable chaos, had one possible solution,
namely, liberty. 'We have seen and heard everything,'
said Diesbach; 'the only means of enjoying
peace is to <i>permit every one to follow the movements of
his conscience, so that no one be constrained</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_743" id="Ref_743" href="#Foot_743">[743]</a></span>
Let the mass and feast-days and images remain for those who
like them; but let the preaching of the Gospel be
granted to those who desire it, and let one of the
seven parish churches be assigned them for that purpose.
Let no one be ridiculed for going to mass.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">{515}</a></span>
<i>Let every one abide in his own free-will and choice.</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_744" id="Ref_744" href="#Foot_744">[744]</a></span>... Moreover,
as the Old and New Testaments are
the foundation of our faith, and as those who follow
the Gospel cannot exist without reading them, let
the booksellers be permitted to sell publicly the Holy
Scriptures and any other books of piety.' Thus
'liberty for all' was the great salutary principle
then proclaimed in Geneva. This theory, which gives
honour to God and independence to man, was not
generally admitted until two or three hundred years
later. But we take note of the epoch when the right
was first proclaimed. It is sometimes asserted that
the idea of liberty for all only appeared in the 18th
century, and that it was put forward for the first time
by the free-thinkers of England, France, and Holland.
It is not so: religious as well as political liberty
asserted their just and holy claims at Geneva more
than three centuries ago. Switzerland and the Reform
are the first in the field. These principles were
so simple and so true that the Council was convinced;
in the face, however, of formidable adversaries, they
feared their own weakness. The syndics replied to the
Messieurs of Berne: 'Stay with us to help us!' The
27th of May, 1533, deserves a mark of honour in the
annals of religious liberty.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XIX.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">CATASTROPHE.<br />
 (<span class="smc">Beginning of July, 1533.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHILE these fine liberal theories were being proclaimed
at the hôtel de ville and hailed with
joy by noble minds, some enemies of the Reform maintained
that they were only got up for the occasion,
because the reformed were not yet the strongest party,
and the bulk of the people, who looked upon them as
mere trash, was occupied with other things. The
report grew stronger every day that the bishop had
made up his mind at last, that his resolution was not
to be shaken, and that in obedience to the pope he
was about to return to Geneva. The liberty so lately
proclaimed was, therefore, seriously endangered.</p>

<p class="side">=PREPARATIONS TO RECEIVE THE BISHOP.=</p>

<p>Every preparation was made for the reception of
the prince, whose approaching arrival began to turn
people's heads, as usually happens in such a case.
Priests, mamelukes, and ducal partisans believed that
the hour of their triumph was at hand, and that independence
and Reform would be effectually buried.
Every man who owned a horse had him dressed, as
no one was permitted to go and meet the bishop on foot.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_745" id="Ref_745" href="#Foot_745">[745]</a></span>
The trumpeters rehearsed, the artillerymen
got out their guns. Jacques de Malbuisson, one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">{517}</a></span>
the chiefs of the catholic party, thinking that there
was nothing too fine for a bishop and prince, especially
for one who was bringing to the city, as a token of
welcome, submission to the pope in religious matters,
and to an ecclesiastical sovereign in temporal
matters, hung the walls of the episcopal palace
with beautiful tapestry, covered the tables and floors
with silk and woollen cloth, and filled the rooms with
rich furniture. Pierre de la Baume had appointed
him quartermaster, and the good catholic intended
that the beauty of the decorations should make the
Genevans comprehend the greatness of their prince.</p>

<p>If a servile crowd was preparing to sacrifice to a
priest the liberties of the people and the Word of
God, those who esteemed these treasures far above all
others, anticipated with sorrow that all the old vexations
were about to be revived. The Two Hundred
were assembled: one proud huguenot, jealous of
the political liberties, could not contain himself, and
rising in the Council, said: 'There is a report that
the mamelukes who deserted the city some seven
years ago are to escort the bishop and return with
him: I ask if it is true?' Instantly the storm broke
out. Some said 'Yes!' others 'No!' The debate
grew warm; they provoked and abused each other,
gave one another the lie, and used very irritating language.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_746" id="Ref_746" href="#Foot_746">[746]</a></span>
At last the huguenots conquered, and the
Two Hundred ordered that the mamelukes should not
be allowed to enter, for fear that there should be
discord instead of harmony in the city.</p>

<p>The syndics foresaw that such a resolution would
probably excite confusion in the procession accompanying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">{518}</a></span>
the bishop; and as they wished to avoid all
disputes, they sought an opportunity for bringing
men's minds together. Assembling the leaders of
the opposing parties, they entreated them, as a sign
of peace, to dine together. Such a banquet, they
thought, would reconcile factions and dissipate the
fears of the prelate. It was an <i>argumentum ad hominem</i>.
How could Pierre de la Baume be afraid of men
who drank together? Libations were indeed copiously
poured out in honour of concord, for the Genevans
were always ready in this respect; but the convictions
of the two parties remained the same. Wine had no
power to change either the champions of the pope or
of the people, neither the Guelphs nor the Ghibelines.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_747" id="Ref_747" href="#Foot_747">[747]</a></span></p>

<p>On Tuesday, 1st of July, the prince-bishop descended
the Jura, attended by his chancellors, the
president De Gevigny and many of the nobility, meditating
the counter-revolution he hoped to bring about.
The Friburg deputies, 'knowing the prelate's timid humour,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_748" id="Ref_748" href="#Foot_748">[748]</a></span>
went to meet him at Gex, in order to
protect his entrance. They turned back with him and
drew near the city. This event, which filled the
catholics with joy, was a great trouble to the proud
huguenots and pious evangelicals, and nearly broke
their hearts. The procession seemed to them like a
funeral train. Were independence, liberty, the growing
Reform—those inestimable riches which are the
life of man—to be carried like a dead body to the
grave? Were those bells, just beginning to ring,
tolling a funeral knell? Everything seemed to point
that way.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">{519}</a></span></p>

<p>Just as the brilliant escort that was riding out to
meet the bishop crossed the bridge over the Rhone,
a troop of about fourscore catholics appeared, all
carrying arquebuses. The premier syndic, who was
watching them with uneasy look, ordered them to
return. 'We are going to our prince,' answered they
with spirit. The magistrates and their escort lost
sight of them for a few moments, but the troop was
again visible when the procession got out of the city.
'They are the most violent of the party,' said some
of the syndic's followers. 'They will play us some
scurvy trick.' A second time the syndic ordered
them to return, and a second time they answered,
'We are going to our prince,' and continued their way.</p>

<p class="side">=THE BISHOP'S ENTRANCE.=</p>

<p>The cortège having proceeded half a league from
the city, waited for the bishop, who came in sight
about four in the afternoon. By his side were the
magistrates of Friburg, and behind him the chiefs of
the mamelukes, banished from Geneva but proud of
braving those who had expelled them. The intimidated
syndics dared not forbid their entrance into
the city. Nor was this all: the fourscore arquebusiers
surrounded the prelate, assuming the duty of a body-guard.
The bells rang out, the artillery roared, and
the friends of the clergy shouted repeated <i>vivats</i>.
The throne was regaining strength; the majesty of
the prince enhanced its splendour, and His Highness
inspired respect in all who saw him.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_749" id="Ref_749" href="#Foot_749">[749]</a></span></p>

<p>These bursts of joy soon came to an end. The
bishop had hardly entered the city, when its appearance
changed. New faces were seen everywhere—faces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">{520}</a></span>
which seemed to breathe of nothing but revenge.
At night conferences were held at the palace, among
the canons and the other partisans of despotic rule.
Everyone talked about the horrible resolutions come
to in these meetings—it was all the same whether
the resolutions were true or fictitious. Many of the
reformed were exceedingly distressed. 'The heretics
felt great contrition,' says Sister Jeanne, 'for they
knew full well that the bishop brought no good to
them, but would injure them as much as he could.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_750" id="Ref_750" href="#Foot_750">[750]</a></span></p>

<p>The prelate was firmly resolved to have recourse,
if necessary, to force, banishment, and death. But
his character and interests inclined him also to
accomplish peacefully, if he could, the great revolution
he so strongly desired. He wished to act in such
a way that appearances at least should be on his side.</p>

<p>Desiring to give his restoration the double sanction
of religion and policy, the bishop ordered a grand
procession for Thursday, 3rd July, after which a
general council of the people should be held. The
procession took place: canons, priests, and friars,
walking in order, sang or chanted their litanies with
great fervour, and prayed that God and the Virgin
would be pleased to preserve the holy Roman Catholic
Church in Geneva. When the singing was over,
the general council was held. The refugees, who had
forgotten nothing and learnt nothing, would have
preferred a prompt and vigorous repression to this
liberal meeting; but the bishop was unwilling to
begin by imprisoning citizens. Besides, the impatient
exiles would lose nothing by waiting.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_751" id="Ref_751" href="#Foot_751">[751]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">{521}</a></div>

<p class="side">=THE BISHOP AT THE GENERAL COUNCIL.=</p>

<p>All the bishop's partisans proceeded proud and
joyful to the council of the people; the magistrates
with uneasiness, and a few huguenots with sad and
suffering looks. As soon as the assembly was formed,
the prelate appeared, attended by his nobles. He was
determined to claim full sovereign power in Geneva,
and to take it by force if it were disputed. Two
great principles—the good pleasure of the prince and
the constitutions of the people—met face to face on
the 3rd of July, in the general council of Geneva.
La Baume had taken his precautions; he had brought
several distinguished men with him from Franche
Comté, and among them the bailiff of Dôle, a learned
and eloquent magistrate. This orator, imagining to
win the Genevans by flattering and flowery language,
delivered a very fine oration; but his Burgundian
eloquence produced no great effect upon the huguenots.
After him the prince-bishop came forward,
and, speaking with a fine clear voice and in very
intelligible language, he asked the syndics and the
people whether they recognised him for their prince
and lord. The question was skilfully put. If they
answered <i>No</i>, they made themselves rebels, and severe
measures became lawful; while, if they answered <i>Yes</i>,
they surrendered to the prelate, and all was over
with liberty and the Gospel. The magistrates, who
were careful not to fall into a trap, saw that it was
necessary to make a distinction. Convinced that they
held their charters, franchises, and legislation from
God quite as much as the prince did his power, they
made a reserve. 'Certainly, my lord,' they replied,
'we regard you as our prince, and are ready to obey
you; <i>but in adopting for guide our liberties, customs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">{522}</a></span>
and franchises, written and unwritten, which we beg you
to respect, as you promised to do a long while ago</i>.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_752" id="Ref_752" href="#Foot_752">[752]</a></span>
The embarrassed bishop-prince thought it essential
not to open up the delicate question of the constitution
he had ratified, and, letting alone for the moment
all that concerned his temporal power, he spoke only
as a bishop, and delivered to the Genevans a devout
exhortation on the salvation of their souls. In
reality, the great object of his terror was the Reformation;
the great desire of his heart was the triumph
of the papacy. 'Have the fear of God before your
eyes,' he said, 'and keep the commandments of holy
Church.' He knew full well that 'holy Church'
would recommend the people to recognise his power
without any restriction. He pronounced these words
'in so devout and humble a manner that everybody
wept, and the general council broke up without dispute
or tumult, for which God be praised.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_753" id="Ref_753" href="#Foot_753">[753]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE CHARTERS CONSULTED.=</p>

<p>The Genevans were not, however, ready to bend
their necks to receive the yoke the bishop presented
to them. The various members of the assembly had
hardly dispersed before the agitation broke out. Huguenots
and independent catholics declared boldly
and with one accord that they would maintain the
constitution; the courtiers and mamelukes alone supported
the absolute privileges of the prelate. 'No
despotic power,' said one party. 'No resistance to
the orders of our prince,' said the other. Offended
at the new pretensions of the bishop, the citizens
resolved to oppose him with the antique monuments
of their liberty. There was a vaulted chamber in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">{523}</a></span>
the hôtel de ville called the <i>Grotto</i>, in which the
venerable charters of the Genevan people were enclosed
under many bolts and bars. Not suffering
themselves to be disturbed by the arbitrariness of
the bishop, by the eloquence of his orators, or the
terrible bands of Friburg and Turin, the citizens
determined to consult the sacred documents of their
franchises. The syndics proceeded to the Grotto;
the rusty bolts yielded to the stout arms of their
officers; they took out the noble parchments of their
ancestors, and all eyes were eagerly turned upon the
title-deeds in which were inscribed the duties, rights,
and liberties of the people. The roll was placed
upon the table; it was unfolded, and, while the
others listened, one of the magistrates read the words
written therein. 'In the name of the holy, perfect,
and undivided Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.'
Could the bishop trample under foot a charter which
reposed on so sacred a foundation? The magistrate
continued his examination. This document, drawn
up by Bishop Adhemar in 1387, contained (to use
its own words) 'the liberties, franchises, and immunities
which the citizens of Geneva have enjoyed so
long that the memory of man runneth not to the
contrary.' The Genevans were moved, and passing
the parchment from hand to hand, read certain portions
of it, and swore to defend their rights.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_754" id="Ref_754" href="#Foot_754">[754]</a></span></p>

<p>The syndics having no doubt that these old documents
would be received by the bishop with the
profoundest respect, quitted the hôtel de ville, carrying
their venerable charters with them, which they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">{524}</a></span>
laid before the prelate. They pointed out to him the
immunities that were secured to them, and withdrew
full of hope. But Pierre de la Baume did not care the
least for these old papers, and would not give himself
the trouble to decipher such disagreeable documents:
he was in a hurry to see them restored to the cellar
where they had slept so long. He intended to govern
after a more modern fashion. The Reformation,
on the other hand, was about to be accomplished by
maintaining, in opposition to episcopal usurpation,
the most lawful rights of the most ancient liberty.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_755" id="Ref_755" href="#Foot_755">[755]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=DESPOTIC PLANS.=</p>

<p>The bishop no longer hesitated. When he had
asked the general council to recognise his sovereignty,
the magistrates had replied by limiting it according
to the constitutions of the people. It was necessary
therefore to renounce all idea of reigning with mildness,
and to govern by force. Pierre de la Baume
was not the first bishop excluded from his episcopal
city, who had reentered it with thoughts of violence.
Tales of unheard-of cruelties had been imprinted on
the memory of the people. In the tenth century,
the bishop of Cambray having been driven from his
city by the burgesses who were exasperated against
him, had returned with foreign soldiers; and these
mercenaries, the ministers of his revenge, had pursued
the citizens even into the churches, killing some,
cutting off the hands and feet of others, putting out
the eyes of some, and branding many on the forehead
with a red-hot iron.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_756" id="Ref_756" href="#Foot_756">[756]</a></span>
About two centuries later,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">{525}</a></span>
another bishop also returning forcibly into his city,
his followers had seized one of the most respected and
wealthy citizens, notwithstanding the promise to
spare his life, and had fastened him by the feet
to the tail of a horse, which they forced into a gallop.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_757" id="Ref_757" href="#Foot_757">[757]</a></span>
The bishop of Geneva did not purpose
imitating these episcopal proceedings; manners,
though rude, were softened; he meant to content
himself with less. He would have the principal
supporters of the Reformation and of Geneva seized,
and would get rid of them simply by the sword—either
in Geneva, as in the case of Berthelier, or in
some lonely castle, as in the case of Levrier. Then
the prince-bishop would exercise, without control
and in his own way, that sovereignty which appeared
to him absolutely necessary in order to stifle the
protestantism of some and the independence of
others.</p>

<p>Freed from the importunate antiquarians who put
their trust in dusty charters, the bishop began to
prepare for the execution of his designs. He counted
his forces and felt sure of victory. In the first place
there was the Council, which, being mostly catholic,
supported him at heart; then there were the priests
and their adherents; then the Friburgers; then the
banished mamelukes, and finally a certain class of
people, skilful in the use of the arquebuse, 'and who
would handle it well,' said the bishop. The total of
his partisans being thus reckoned, the bishop enquired
who were the huguenot chiefs he ought to get rid of.
It is hardly probable that La Baume did this alone
or simply aided by one of his secretaries or officers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">{526}</a></span>
of justice. Weakness was one of the most marked
features of his character; he had no energy, although
he sometimes pretended the contrary. But those
around him made up for it. The proscription that
he was about to carry into execution was essentially
due to the encouragements and solicitations of the
enemies of the Reformation and of independence.
'Finding himself strong and powerful,' says a contemporary,
'both on the part of the Friburgers and
of the enemies of God and the city (namely, the
mamelukes) who were now within the walls, the
bishop desired to exercise his tyranny.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_758" id="Ref_758" href="#Foot_758">[758]</a></span>
Some of his friends shrank from such severity, and would have
desired to divert him from it; but the most violent
men prevailed. 'My lord,' they said, 'must exercise
his power against certain citizens and burgesses, and
by this means extirpate and eradicate the Lutheran
sect and heresy.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_759" id="Ref_759" href="#Foot_759">[759]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=PROSCRIPTIONS.=</p>

<p>The proscribed were selected indifferently from
among the evangelicals and huguenots. One of the
first pointed at was Chautemps. He was not only a
heretic, but his children had been trained up in
heresy, and he had kept for a long time in his house
Olivetan, the translator of the Bible, who had dared
reprimand a dominican preacher in full church. Aimé
Levet came next; at his house the religious meetings
were most frequently held. Pierre Vandel—youngest
son of that Claude, whom twenty years before
Bishop John of Savoy had cast into prison<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_760" id="Ref_760" href="#Foot_760">[760]</a></span>—a
man of resolute character, readily putting himself in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">{527}</a></span>
foreground, was joined with the other two. Ami
Perrin did not belong to the evangelicals properly
so called, but he had been the chief of the four
huguenots whose zeal for controversy had proved
so embarrassing to the vicar of the Madeleine,
and passed for the boldest of all the band.
Others were afterwards pointed out: Jean Pecolat,
an ill-sounding name in episcopal ears; Domaine
d'Arlod, Jean Veillard, Anthonin Derbey, Henry
Doulens, Jacques Fichet, Claude de Genève, and
Philibert de Compey, a nobleman in high esteem.
Although a Savoyard and of gentle birth, Philibert
was huguenot at heart; the count of Genevois took
advantage of the opportunity to confiscate all his
lands and lordships, 'and the poor pervert was
deprived of his property,' says a contemporary.
There were still a few more whose arrest was determined
on, and among them Pasta and Rozetta.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_761" id="Ref_761" href="#Foot_761">[761]</a></span>
The bishop and his friends, all full of zeal, hoped
to catch other citizens after these;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_762" id="Ref_762" href="#Foot_762">[762]</a></span>
but they thought it prudent not to do everything at once.
If the first attempt succeeded, they would follow
it up by a second, and would lay their hands
upon such citizens as they had not thought of at
first. 'I have proscribed all those whom I can
remember; those whom I have forgotten I will proscribe
as they recur to my mind.' This saying of
a great master in the art, found its application
in Geneva.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_763" id="Ref_763" href="#Foot_763">[763]</a></span></p>

<p>The bishop, having ended his first task, began to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">{528}</a></span>
consider how he could lay hold of the proscribed,
which was no easy matter. The most natural way
would have been to capture each of them in his own
house; but he feared, that if he went to work in
that fashion, some would hide themselves, others
would escape, and others would be rescued in the
streets. The alarm would spread in a moment, and
the daring huguenots would entrench themselves in
Baudichon de la Maisonneuve's house. Above all,
Pierre de la Baume was wanting in frankness; he
excelled, whenever he pleased, in appearing amiable to
those whom he hated. He resolved to give them an
invitation, and to hold out his hand graciously to the
men whose death he was plotting. He will invite
them to his palace, 'trusting in his faith,' but without
keeping it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_764" id="Ref_764" href="#Foot_764">[764]</a></span>
He will thus take them all by one cast
of the net, then he will tie the knot, and the poor
wretches shall leave the saloons of the palace only to
descend to its dungeons. It was thought an excellent
stratagem, and preparations were made for carrying
it out.</p>

<p>The next day, July 5th, the bishop's officers called
on the citizens entered in the black list, and in his
name gave them an invitation, which must have appeared
to them either a great honour or a treacherous
snare. If any of them raised objections, the messengers
assured them, in the prelate's name, that no
harm would come to them. Some through candour,
others from ignorance, and others also from rashness,
proceeded to the episcopal palace. They had put on
their finest suits and wore their swords. What could
the bishop want with them?... Probably to obtain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">{529}</a></span>
some concessions, and they were firmly decided not
to make any.</p>

<p>Others, who were more clear-sighted or more prudent,
took to flight. The clerical riots which had
preceded the bishop's coming, the unsatisfactory
company by which he was surrounded, and the
demands he had made—all combined to give food for
thought to minds possessed of any discernment.
Women, more keen or more timid, generally see
clearer in such cases than men: their conjugal love
takes the alarm. It would appear that Claudine
Levet and Jaquéma Chautemps felt all the tender
solicitude of their sex, and conjured their husbands
not to place themselves in the cruel hands of the
bishop, and to quit their homes, their children, and
their country which they could now serve better
abroad. These two excellent christians were among
the number of those who escaped. Maisonneuve,
against whom the mamelukes were much irritated,
set out for Berne, full of indignation against the
bishop's tyranny. To this city, next to God, he
always looked for deliverance. Several others also
quitted Geneva.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_765" id="Ref_765" href="#Foot_765">[765]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=HUGUENOTS ENTRAPPED.=</p>

<p>Meantime Perrin, D'Arlod, Vandel, and their
friends proceeded to the palace. The gates opened
before them and they entered my lord's antechambers.
But they had hardly arrived, reckoning on
the gracious audience that had been promised them,
when they were seized, heavily fettered, and led
away to the episcopal prison.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_766" id="Ref_766" href="#Foot_766">[766]</a></span>
The impetuous Perrin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">{530}</a></span>
and the courageous Vandel were compelled to yield
to force. The bishop's officers took them down into
the dungeons, and as if cords, iron doors, and bolts
were not enough, their feet were set in the stocks
and their hands were manacled.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_767" id="Ref_767" href="#Foot_767">[767]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=CONJUGAL DEVOTION.=</p>

<p>When the news was told the prince-prelate, it was
the pleasantest tidings he had ever received. He
breathed again, and yet he was not entirely satisfied:
he wanted some prisoners whom he had especially
set his heart upon—particularly Levet and Chautemps.
But if the husbands had disappeared, their
wives might suffer for them. Pierre de la Baume
ordered Jaquéma Chautemps to be seized, but Claudine
Levet remained at liberty. Claudine was a pious
christian woman, firm in faith but of gentle character,
and she was spared; but Jaquéma, who it will be remembered
was taught by Olivetan, possessed perhaps some
of that courageous decision which was found in
Calvin's cousin and in Calvin himself. Claudine was
the woman of the New Testament; Jaquéma seems
rather to remind us of the heroines of the Old. It
is to be regretted that we have not the same information
about her as about Claudine. At all events she
paid for her husband. The delicate woman, the wife
of one of the chief persons in the city, accustomed
to the comforts of life, used to the company of
one of the most original French writers of the day,
the tutor to her children, was shut up in a narrow
cell, and treated roughly like a conspirator. Ancient
and modern times have witnessed more than one instance
of conjugal devotion. Many wives, seeing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">{531}</a></span>
their husbands threatened with a cruel death, have
been able to say to them:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">

<div class="verse">. . . . . . Et quel autre que moi</div>
<div class="verse">A le droit d'y prétendre et de mourir pour toi?<span
     class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_768" id="Ref_768" href="#Foot_768">[768]</a></span></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Reformation also has furnished many similar
examples.</p>

<p>As part of the huguenot leaders were now in
prison, the bishop and his confidants deliberated what
should be done with them. It was quite out of the
question to put them to death publicly in Geneva,
like Berthelier. The simplest way would be to behead
them secretly in their dungeons; but that would be
known immediately, and would create terrible excitement.
'They durst not kill them in the city for fear
of the people.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_769" id="Ref_769" href="#Foot_769">[769]</a></span>
The bishop's councillors proposed
to send them out of Geneva in a boat by night, and
convey them either to Friburg, which was calling for
victims to avenge Wernli's death, or to the castle of
Chillon, where Bonivard was shut up, or to Jussy
near Mount Voiron, or lastly to the strong castle of
Gaillard at the foot of the Salève, 'and there do
as they pleased with them.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_770" id="Ref_770" href="#Foot_770">[770]</a></span>
They decided on the
last plan, and orders were given for carrying it out.</p>

<p>Thus everything proceeded to the bishop's satisfaction.
As some of the principal huguenots were
about to be sent out of Geneva, it became necessary
'to catch other citizens after them and serve them
the same,' that is, carry them also out of the city;
for the fear of the people continually pursued the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">{532}</a></span>
bishop. He was planning how to continue the
work he had undertaken, when news was brought
him which greatly troubled him.</p>

<p>One of his agents, commissioned by him to take
note of everything that occurred in the city, came and
told him that not only Baudichon de la Maisonneuve
had escaped, but that he had gone to Berne to demand
help.... What a check! what danger! If the fugitive
brings back the Bernese, they will undertake the
defence of heresy ... it will triumph. The harder the
blow which La Baume desired to strike, the more
dangerous would it be if it failed. He was therefore
in great alarm and in a great passion also. He ordered
his officers to pursue those who had escaped, to take
horses so as to catch them up, and to bring them
back bound to prison where their friends awaited
them. But he did not rest satisfied with sending after
the fugitives such persons as were under his own
orders, he wanted others to track them down, to
catch them in the rear or in front: this induced
him to make a very extraordinary demand.</p>

<p>As soon as the syndics had heard of the arrest of
some of the most notable of the citizens, they had
summoned the council. Astounded at the tyrannical
act, and alarmed for the future of the republic, they
deliberated what was to be done. Should they abandon
their fellow-citizens to the illegal vengeance of the
bishop, or should they revolt against their prince?
They were plunged into silent stupor when a messenger
from the bishop appeared. No doubt he had
come to give some explanation, to make an excuse,
and perhaps to declare that the bishop would withdraw
his fatal decree! No such thing: the council
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">{533}</a></span>
soon learnt that he was charged with an extraordinary
message.</p>

<p class="side">=STRANGE REQUEST OF THE BISHOP.=</p>

<p>The episcopal messenger, having made the customary
salutations, said: 'My lord has decided to
send his officers beyond the frontiers to take certain
<i>criminals</i> (this was the term he applied to those
noble citizens). Our very reverend prince therefore
requires the council to lend him some of the city
officers to accompany his own and pursue the fugitives
in the territory of Savoy.' This was too
much. De la Baume required the magistrates of
Geneva to employ in oppressing citizens the power
they had received to defend them. Such an audacious
proposition disgusted the syndics; they did not
hesitate to refuse his demand; desiring, however, to
keep on good terms with him to the last, they gave
a specious motive for their refusal. 'Pray pardon
us,' they answered the bishop, 'if we cannot do it;
we should be afraid lest the duke, whose territories
our officers would have to enter, should be angry
with us for violating the treaties.' This refusal
threw him into a great passion. He believed, perhaps
not without reason, that the duke of Savoy would
overlook the violation of territory, as its object was
to catch huguenots. 'Return,' he said to his officer,
'and tell those gentlemen to do justice, and that if
they do not, there are fourscore in the city who will
help me to do it. Add, that they are to act straightforwardly.'
The magistrates remained firm. But
the prelate found some little consolation in the
cooperation of people better disposed than the syndics
of Geneva to subserve his anger.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_771" id="Ref_771" href="#Foot_771">[771]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">{534}</a></div>

<p>Aimé Levet, instead of escaping by the right bank,
on which his house was situated, had chosen the
left bank, and thrown himself into that beautiful
country which extends between the Rhone and the
lake on one side, and Mount Voiron and Mount
Salève on the other, and where the wide opening
which these two mountains leave between them, permits
the traveller to contemplate the magnificent
range of the Alps of Mont Blanc. Was it Levet's
wish to avoid taking the usual road of the fugitives,
on which he was sure to be arrested; or did he intend
hiding in the mountains, as the fine month of July
invited him, to climb the easy and graceful slope of
the Voiron, or to scale, by the road called l'Echelle
(the ladder), the abrupt walls of Salève, whose enormous
rocks overhang the plain? That is possible;
other fugitives had done so. Levet wandered for
some time in that part of the valley where the sandy
torrent of the Arve utters a low murmur; but,
thinking only how he should escape his persecutors,
he had no leisure to contemplate the dazzling vision
of the Alps lighted up by a July sun, which made so
striking a contrast with the gloomy paths he was then
traversing. He knew that mamelukes, priests, ducal
partisans, and above all, the Sire de Montagny,
castellan of Gaillard, would follow in his track. How
strange his destiny! Only a few months ago he had
been a zealous catholic, and then the surprising conversion
of his wife had led to his.... Now, he
was wandering about as a fugitive, without a place
where to lay his head. We cannot tell all the
anguish he went through, and all the groans he
uttered. He did not lose courage, however, for he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">{535}</a></span>
knew Him who was his protector, and who maintains
the right. He was assured of being able to
stand before God and His angels at the very moment
when men were hunting him down. He had wolves
behind him eager to tear him in pieces, but 'God
saves His poor sheep, even out of the jaws of the
lions.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_772" id="Ref_772" href="#Foot_772">[772]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=LEVET PURSUED AND TAKEN.=</p>

<p>They were indeed in pursuit of him. Messire de
Charanzonay, a canon of Geneva, had kept his eye on
Levet: he knew that he had made off in the direction
of the mountains, and that he must be found
either in the bailiwick of Gaillard, or in the parish
of Bonne. He had an interview, therefore, with the
castellan of Gaillard, M. de Montagny, a good catholic
and Savoyard, who furnished him with aid; a band of
men left the castle, and the chase began, the canon
leading the way. Erelong, poor Levet heard the
footsteps of the people in search of him: he was
seized. The canon, eager to vent his anger, had him
scourged without any form of trial, and after he had
been soundly beaten, sent him off to the castle of Gaillard.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_773" id="Ref_773" href="#Foot_773">[773]</a></span>
Levet, encompassed by guards, was conducted
to that fortress, situated at the point where
the Arve, issuing from the mountains, enters the
plain, and where many an innocent man had been imprisoned.
The drawbridge fell and rose again, the
massive gates opened, the armed sentinels halted to see
the huguenot pass, and at last Levet, doubly guilty, as
a liberal and as an evangelical, was thrown into a deep
dungeon. From that moment the husband's captivity
assured the liberty of the wife.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">{536}</a></div>

<p class="side">=FRIBURG DEPUTIES CALL FOR REVENGE.=</p>

<p>Other circumstances happening on the same day
(6th of July) rejoiced the bishop and his court, and put
to the proof the firmness of the council as well as the
tranquillity of the citizens. A man sent from the
Pays de Vaud reported that a number of well-armed
Friburgers had arrived at Nyon and threatened Geneva.
They were the avengers of Wernli's blood.
'Go and tell the captain-general,' said the syndics,
'and bid him look to the safety of the city.' Shortly
after this, a citizen told the council that the Friburgers
who were in Geneva were preparing to set
out for the castle of Gaillard. Presently a third
person came and informed the syndics that the Friburgers
were crossing the lake from Nyon, and that
their boats could be clearly distinguished from the
upper part of the city, making for the south. Finally,
news came from Gaillard that Wernli's relations,
accompanied by a great number of Friburg men-at-arms,
had entered the fortress, vowing they would
wash their feet in the blood of the evangelicals. The
council did not know what to do, and the city was
filled with apprehension.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_774" id="Ref_774" href="#Foot_774">[774]</a></span></p>

<p>The extremes of anguish were felt in the homes of
the prisoners. The most sinister stories were propagated
through the city as to the severity employed
by the bishop towards his captives. Some began to
lose courage and to ask—it was a question often put
in the time of the Reformation—why the disciples of
the Gospel had to endure not only the afflictions
common to all men, but calamities from which their
enemies were exempt? 'Ah!' replied the wiser ones,
'the corn is first threshed in the barn along with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">{537}</a></span>
straw; but afterwards it is pressed and crushed alone
on the millstone.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_775" id="Ref_775" href="#Foot_775">[775]</a></span>
All were not to be comforted,
and from many an afflicted house the cries of sorrow
rose to heaven.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the avoyers of Friburg pressed the
council to grant to Wernli's relations the justice they
demanded, and insisted that the Genevans arrested
on the 23rd May and 4th June should be brought
to trial immediately. The mamelukes cried still
louder than the Friburgers, and demanded the trial
of the eleven persons imprisoned on the 5th July.
While the case of the Friburgers was entirely judicial,
that of the mamelukes was political: they wished to
take advantage of a trial to effect a revolution. The
council instructed the procurator-fiscal to have the
accused brought before him, as the Genevan constitution
required; but the fiscal declared he could not
do so on account of the order of the prince, who had
cited the case before himself. The bishop meant to
be at once judge and interested party, and to substitute
clerical despotism for the protecting forms of the
lay tribunals. The alarmed magistrates immediately
waited on the prince to make their humble but resolute
protest.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_776" id="Ref_776" href="#Foot_776">[776]</a></span></p>

<p>Pierre de la Baume had just dined when the
syndics appeared. 'I have cited the cause before me,'
he said: 'I have my reasons.' The syndics represented
to him that he might pardon men after
sentence, but not try accused persons, who must
necessarily appear before the lawful tribunals. 'I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">{538}</a></span>
cite the case before me,' repeated the bishop. The
indignant syndics bowed and withdrew. Sebastian
de Diesbach, the banneret of Weingarten and other
deputies from Berne, had arrived at Geneva, and
Baudichon de la Maisonneuve, as it seems, had returned
with them. The syndics prayed their intervention,
and the Bernese spoke to the bishop; but the
passionate headstrong churchman would not listen to
them. He stretched the cord at the risk of breaking
it. 'I have cited the case before me,' he said again.</p>

<p>The spirit of blind fanaticism was felt in other
places besides the palace: it agitated the mamelukes,
carried away the episcopalians and even a few of the
Friburgers. They had sworn the death of liberty
and the Reformation, and were already planning the
means of preventing for ever their return to Geneva.
They went up and down the city, and were quite
indefatigable. As you looked at them you would
have said—the comparison was made at the time—that
coming after the deluge, and wishing to prevent
the waters from invading their dwellings again, they
had said to one another: 'Let us build a tower whose
top may reach unto heaven.' 'They built the tower
of Babel,' says a contemporary, 'presuming, like the
giants, to fight against God.'</p>

<p class="side">=ATTACKS ON HUGUENOTS.=</p>

<p>They did indeed come to blows. On that very day
(7th July) some horsemen of the episcopal party who
were riding at Plainpalais in front of the convent of
their friends the Dominicans, saw three of the most
considerable of the Genevese citizens go past: they
were Philippe the captain-general, John Lullin afterwards
syndic, and Francis Favre who was a member
of the ordinary council in the following year. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">{539}</a></span>
cavaliers immediately rode at them, calling them
traitors and Lutherans. The three huguenots were
hated and feared by the mamelukes, who knew them
to be men ready to sacrifice their lives for the ancient
liberties of their country. If they had not been
included in the first proscription, it was partly through
fear, for their boldness was indomitable; and also
because it had been preferred to begin with pious
evangelicals like Chautemps and Levet. True, Ami
Perrin had been arrested; but without having undergone
the great change which Scripture calls 'a new
birth,' he was still in the front rank whenever the
cause of the Reformation was in question. It was he
who had actively protected Farel. Besides the episcopal
<i>sbirri</i> could not well distinguish between protestants
who were such inwardly and those who were so
outwardly only. However, neither persecution nor
insult abated the courage of the citizens. They knew
that God often suffers the wicked to act for a few
days, and permits them to raise high towers against
his elect. Then on a sudden he strikes the huge
mass, he loosens the joints and scatters the materials,
so that the mighty edifice whose summit was to rise
to heaven falls into dust, and is scattered to the
winds.</p>

<p>The syndics, being determined to resist the bishop
and his usurpations, convened the council of Sixty
on the 8th July, and explained to them how he purposed
to place Geneva under the government of his
good pleasure, and by way of beginning, was preparing
to try in his own court the noblest of the
citizens. The future that threatened Geneva filled
the assembly with emotion and fear. What was to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">{540}</a></span>
be done? Resort to force, policy, or diplomacy?
The Genevans, in self-defence, looked for simpler and
more affecting means; they had recourse to one of
those measures which are almost unique in history,
and exhale a perfume of antiquity.</p>

<p class="side">=ELDERS OF GENEVA BEFORE THE BISHOP.=</p>

<p>There were in Geneva certain Nestors of liberty,
who, uplifting their hoary heads among three generations
of their children, gave utterance to words of
wisdom. To these they had recourse. Councillors—their
sons probably—went to fetch them, and these
venerable witnesses of the ancient liberties entered the
presence of the council, where seats were placed for
them. Although the vigour of their bodies was
weakened, their hearts now beat stronger for their
country than in their younger days, and their memory
recalled to them distinctly the times of yore. Accordingly,
when they heard of the dangers by which
the republic was threatened, and of the bishop's
intention to usurp judicial power, they were filled
with sadness and alarm. 'Criminal causes,' they
said, 'belong to the civil magistrate; the practice has
never varied in that respect, and the bishop's claim
to hear them himself is a novelty without precedent.'
The council of sixty resolved to send a deputation to
the prince, composed of the four syndics and six
of these aged citizens, who felt happy to bear, before
they died, a last testimony to the liberties of their
country. If the bishop laughed at the ancient papers
of ancient Geneva, would he also laugh at these
ancient men?</p>

<p>The deputation, proceeding slowly through the
streets, took its way towards the palace. The fathers
of the country walked with tottering steps, supported
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">{541}</a></span>
by the younger ones, and advanced towards the
residence of the haughty priest whom Rome had sent
to the shores of the Leman, and who was trampling
under foot the most venerable rights. Never had
men going to plead the independence of a nation
inspired more tenderness, sympathy, and respect.
People watched and blessed them as they passed, and
prayers were raised to heaven that God would accompany
with his strength this extraordinary step in
favour of liberty.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_777" id="Ref_777" href="#Foot_777">[777]</a></span></p>

<p>The bishop, informed of the movement, had desired
to surround himself with all that could give a specious
appearance to his usurpations. And accordingly,
when they entered the hall, the deputation found not
only the prelate sitting in pomp—not only his councillors,
officers, and the ambassadors of Berne and
Friburg ranged around him,—but also the relatives of
the canon. Pierre de la Baume paired the suppliants
of Friburg against the elders of Geneva. The syndics
respectfully expressed to him their surprise that he
should appear to look upon the council with suspicion,
that several citizens of note had been thrown into
prison, and lastly that his lordship, contrary to the
laws, had cited the case before his own tribunal.
But, while the elders turned a look at once mild and
penetrating upon the prince, and their hoary heads
seemed, as it were, to bring the old times before him,
Wernli's relatives, shaking their black garments,
again called for vengeance, declaring that the prince
had promised to do them justice, and praying upon
him to be faithful to his word. 'Yes,' said the bishop
immediately, 'yes, I cite the cause before me.' The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">{542}</a></span>
syndics, determined not to give up the most venerated
laws of the State, placed before him the ancient constitution
of the people, and pointing to the twelfth
article, read as follows: 'That no inquisition upon
lay malefactors, or other process whatsoever, can or
shall be held, except by summoning the four syndics
and four citizens of the said city of Geneva, who shall
be chosen by the other citizens.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_778" id="Ref_778" href="#Foot_778">[778]</a></span>
And that the trial
and sentence of the afore-named malefactors belongs
and shall belong to the aforesaid citizens, and not to
any other persons whatsoever.' The constitution
having thus spoken, the syndic ceased.</p>

<p class="side">=THE BISHOP WILL NOT YIELD.=</p>

<p>Then the elders, who had hitherto kept silent, and
whose grave, modest, and firm looks inspired respect,
came forward. One of them, speaking for all, raised
his trembling hands, 'and declared that such had
always been the law of Geneva, and that never in the
course of their long lives had they had the pain to
see the prince trample it under foot.' The feeble
voices and calm looks of these venerable men added
a strange, and one might almost say a heavenly, force
to their testimony. That humble speech in favour
of liberty possessed an eloquence more penetrating
than the most admirable orations of a Cicero or a
Demosthenes. But, if liberty had never been more
touching, despotism had never been more obstinate.
The syndics conjured the bishop in vain, in the name
of the laws and of God, to surrender the prisoners to
them, according to the law, so that they might try
them conformably with their office; Pierre de la
Baume kept repeating: 'I cannot, I have cited the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">{543}</a></span>
cause before me.' The Friburg ambassadors begged
the syndics to consent to the episcopal citation, 'for
this time only,' but the magistrates of Geneva were
unwilling that the franchises of the city should be
violated either now or later. They quitted the bishop's
palace with sorrow, and the six elders followed them.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_779" id="Ref_779" href="#Foot_779">[779]</a></span></p>

<p>When they arrived at the hôtel-de-ville, the council
of sixty was still sitting. They gave a faithful account
of their mission. They reported that the
bishop-prince persisted in his iniquitous <i>non possumus</i>,
and although the council felt deep pain at hearing the
statement, no one flinched. These Genevans knew
the fidelity that freemen owe to the institutions of
their ancestors. The ambassadors of Berne then
asked to be admitted. Importuned by their allies,
the Friburgers, and by the councillors of the bishop,
these haughty Bernese, unfaithful to their renown, had
come to imagine that the Genevans might very well,
for <i>once</i>, on this solemn occasion, renounce their
charter and their rights. Sebastian de Diesbach
therefore invited the council to try if they could not
'consent to this citation, which the prelate positively
would not recal.' Thus the only allies of Geneva
solicited them to enter voluntarily upon the path of
concessions.... The council deliberated, and
the Sixty were unanimous. Here is the resolution
which the secretary entered upon the register: 'Ordered
to reply to My Lords of Berne, that we will
not consent to this citation, as it is entirely contrary
to our franchises, and resolved to ask them to be
pleased to aid us with their advice.' My Lords of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">{544}</a></span>
Berne did not like to see their advice rejected, but as
they withdrew they said that such men deserved to
be free.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_780" id="Ref_780" href="#Foot_780">[780]</a></span></p>

<p>This new refusal exasperated the mamelukes. They
were determined to use Wernli's death as an instrument
of war to beat down the ancient edifice of
Genevese liberties, to root up the foundations of the
Reformation, and to establish on the ruins their
own theories concerning the absolute power of the
pope and the prince. Consequently they demanded
the convocation of the Two Hundred, hoping to find
favourable voices among them. The great council
met the next day, and the Friburg ambassadors
appeared before it, attended by a great number of
the relations and friends of the canon—all dejected,
gloomy, and silent, like the suppliants of ancient
times. It was not fanaticism which animated the
greater part of them. They had played with Wernli
in their childhood; they had loved him in their
youth; they venerated his memory now that a
terrible catastrophe had stretched him dead in the
streets of the city. If they had been unable to defend
him in the hour of danger, they wished to do
everything now the hour of vengeance was come.
It was not sufficient to have sprinkled his body with
their tears, the blood of victims must flow in the very
spot where the martyr had been struck down. 'Most
honoured lords,' said the canon's brother, 'the justice
which men owe to one another is written on earth in
the hearts of the just; why, then, should you trample
it under foot? You have not yet done justice for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">{545}</a></span>
death of him who was our brother and our friend; on
the contrary, you left the criminals free to come and
go for six weeks. His body lies in the grave, but
his blood, sprinkled on the stones of your city, calls for
vengeance. If you are armed with the sword, it is not
for mere show but to strike malefactors. And yet your
tribunals are dumb, and your sword slumbers in the
sheath. Permit my lord bishop to cite the case before
him. If you refuse, you may rest assured that
we shall seek other means of avenging the death of
our friend, and we shall drown our sorrow and anger
not in the waters of justice but in blood.' The
Friburgers spoke as if it were a murder: they
forgot that the canon had put on a cuirass, that
he had grasped the halberd, that he had gone fully
armed to the scene of tumult, that he had rekindled
the dying flames, and attacked the huguenots, who
had only used their arms in legitimate self-defence.
The avoyer of Friburg seconded the eloquent menaces
of Wernli's brother.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_781" id="Ref_781" href="#Foot_781">[781]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=REFUSAL OF THE TWO HUNDRED.=</p>

<p>The Two Hundred saw that a war with Friburg
and Savoy would be the consequence of their refusal,
but they had taken their stand on the rock of right
and were not to be moved. 'We do not know of any
guilty persons who have been allowed to come and go
freely in the city,' they said. 'If it be so, the blame
lies with the procurator-fiscal whose duty it was to
apprehend them, and not with us who are judges.
As for permitting my lord to cite the cause before
him, we cannot do so; it would be a violation of the
franchises, for which we and our forefathers have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">{546}</a></span>
often risked our bodies and our goods.' The syndic
added that the council would consent to the bishop's
naming two persons to be present at the examination,
but on condition that they had no deliberative
voice. The Friburgers and mamelukes could not
make up their minds to accept this proposition. They
were specially vexed that Coquet, syndic of the guard,
whom they looked upon as devoted to the reform,
should be among the number of the judges, whilst
in their opinion he ought to be in the prisoner's
dock.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_782" id="Ref_782" href="#Foot_782">[782]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=ARGUMENTS FOR THE TEMPORAL POWER.=</p>

<p>If it had been a mere question of punishing the
author of the canon's death, the prelate would perhaps
have trusted to the syndics; but he aimed at
destroying both liberty and the Reformation in
Geneva, and for that he trusted to himself alone.
To supplications, threats, and violence some consented
to add reasons. There was a kind of argument used
only in scholastic debates to prove that priests were
the best judges both in civil and political matters.
This strange proposition was demonstrated by syllogism.
The major was: 'He is the best fitted to
judge who is nearest to God.' The minor this:
'Ecclesiastics are nearer to God than laymen.' The
conclusion is evident. They had recourse also to
arguments derived from astronomy. 'As there are
two great lights in the universe,' it was said, 'so
there are also two in society. The Church is the sun
and the State is the moon. Now the moon has no
light of her own; all her light is derived from the
sun. It is evident, therefore, that the church possesses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">{547}</a></span>
in itself, formally and virtually, the temporal
jurisdiction of the state.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_783" id="Ref_783" href="#Foot_783">[783]</a></span></p>

<p>Such arguments had great strength in the prelate's
eyes: he appointed two deputies, his bailiff and his
attorney, and sent them to the Two Hundred with
orders to defend the rights of the sun. The union
of the two powers in a single individual supplied them
with their principal argument. The <span class="smc">bishop</span> was
hardly mentioned in their speech but only the <i>prince</i>.
'The bishop is your prince,' they declared; 'and you,
the syndics, are his officers. He may therefore
command you as his subjects, and when he transfers
to his tribunal a cause which is in your hands, you
have only to obey.' This theory of absolute power
could not pass in Geneva. 'We are not the prince's
officers,' replied the magistrates, 'but syndics of the
city, elected by the people and not by my lord. He
has no power to institute us, and even his own
officers, nominated by himself, make oath to us,
whilst we make oath to nobody.' Then the syndics,
turning to the Friburg deputation, continued: 'Sirs,
you helped us in the time of Berthelier, help us again
now. It is not we, but the bishop and his officers
who alone occasion the delay of which you complain.
Let two deputies from the bishop, two from Berne,
and two from Friburg, assist at the trial, and be
witnesses of our uprightness.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_784" id="Ref_784" href="#Foot_784">[784]</a></span></p>

<p>The bishop persisted in his demand: the deputies
from Berne, desiring to terminate the difference, proposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">{548}</a></span>
that the cause should be remitted to two judges
nominated by the council, two by the bishop, two by
Berne, and two by Friburg. The Genevans replied
that a people were not at liberty to sacrifice the
smallest portion of their rights; and fatigued with
these endless importunities, they added: 'If our offer
is refused, we will convoke the general assembly of
the people and do what it shall ordain.' The Bernese,
knowing very well that if the matter was referred to
the people no arrangement would be possible, exclaimed:
'Pray do nothing of the kind.'</p>

<p>Whilst even Berne was soliciting the syndics to
give way, the wives, relations, and friends of the
prisoners conjured them to persevere in their resistance.
They feared to hear every morning that it
was too late to act. 'It is time to bring the matter
to an end,' said the syndics to the Bernese. 'The
prisoners are only accused; is it just to make them
suffer as if they were guilty? Go and speak plainly
to the prince; make him comprehend the duty which
our liberties impose upon us.' The Bernese went to
the episcopal palace, but neither the bishop nor the
Friburgers who were with him would yield an inch.
'Messieurs of Geneva will not do otherwise than
they have said,' coldly answered Pierre de la Baume.
'Very good! and we for our part will not do otherwise
than we have declared.' The Friburgers added
with a menacing tone: 'We are about to return
home and there ... we shall consider another
remedy.' This remedy was war: the Friburg deputies
would return with an army.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_785" id="Ref_785" href="#Foot_785">[785]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE PRISONERS IN THEIR CELLS.=</p>

<p>While these things were going on, the huguenots
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">{549}</a></span>
and evangelicals, seized by the bishop's order, were
still in prison bound hand and foot. Pierre Vandel,
Claude Pasta, the Sire de Compey, Domaine D'Arlod,
the energetic Ami Perrin and others, not forgetting
Jaquéma, awaited their fate in the gloomy vaults of
the episcopal residence. In every house in Geneva
and at the town-hall people were constantly talking
of them. 'The prisoners,' they said, 'are kept in close
confinement.' Such severity excited universal compassion,
and the secretary of council mentions it
in the Registers.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_786" id="Ref_786" href="#Foot_786">[786]</a></span>
However if the bishop had been
able to deprive them of freedom of motion, there
was another he could not take from them, which
was a sweet consolation for those who had received
the gospel in their hearts. 'Though they were
bound and made fast in the stocks,' says Calvin, 'still
while praying they praised God.' It is of Paul and
Silas, shut up in the prison at Philippi, of whom
the reformer is speaking; but what he says of the
liberty of prayer, which exists even in spite of
chains, may be applied to some of those who were
now in the prelate's dungeons.</p>

<p>Just at this time a report circulated through the
city that the bishop was secretly preparing boats for
the removal of the prisoners to some castle. It was
said that certain stout watermen were ready to grasp
the oar, that an armed force would accompany the captives,
and that as soon the episcopal officers were
upon the open lake they would laugh at the syndics
and the huguenots. These reports still more excited
the anger of the citizens. One of them, a daring
man named Pierre Verne, watching the boats moored
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">{550}</a></span>
on the shore, sought the means of preventing this
unlawful abduction: he thought he had found one,
simple and in his opinion infallible, and waited (as
we shall see presently) until the veil of night concealed
him from the eyes of the enemy.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_787" id="Ref_787" href="#Foot_787">[787]</a></span></p>

<p>If the prince's councillors were contriving how
to get the huguenot captives away, certain of the
mamelukes were vexed that there were still so many
at liberty, and that the bishop was so slow in apprehending
them all without exception. It seemed
to them that the <i>coup d'état</i>, or rather <i>coup de main</i>,
of which they had dreamt was long in coming; and
they knew that if a bold stroke is to succeed, the
execution must be prompt. Some of them began
therefore to make amends for official slowness by
separate acts of violence.</p>

<p class="side">=ATTEMPT TO MURDER CURTET.=</p>

<p>It was harvest time, and Jean Ami Curtet or
Curteti, a man well disposed towards the Gospel and
belonging to a family which Duke Philibert le Beau
had ennobled, had gone out in the morning to visit
a field which he possessed on the banks of the Arve.
He examined the ears and the stalks: everything
promised a fine harvest. Knowing that when wheat
is once ripe, there should be no delay in reaping it, he
ordered the labourer who accompanied him to begin
to cut it. But he was destined to fall before his corn,
and on that very spot.... A sudden noise was
heard, some men in disguise fell upon him, knocked
him down, beat him and left him for dead in his
own field. The news soon reached the city. 'It is
some gentlemen in disguise who have murdered him,'
said the people. On hearing the mournful news, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">{551}</a></span>
relations and friends of Curtet seized their arquebuses,
and about forty of them hastened towards the Arve
bridge. They raised the poor man who was seriously
wounded, and bearing their sad burden returned slowly
into the city, their hearts bursting with anger. As
the procession passed in front of a house where some
Friburgers lodged, one of the Genevans called them
'Rascals and traitors!' The Friburgers, innocent of
the attempt, swore that they would demand satisfaction
for such an outrage; but the sad procession, passing
slowly through the principal streets of Geneva,
under the windows of the chief citizens, called up very
different thoughts. Men asked each other whether
the partisans of the prince-bishop intended to add
murder to illegal arrest; whether it was sufficient to
wear a mask and strange garments to deprive citizens
of their lives, without any risk to the murderers; and
whether every huguenot, as he was engaging in
the most innocent occupations, might be suddenly
laid dead by a masked enemy in the fields bequeathed
to him by his ancestors?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_788" id="Ref_788" href="#Foot_788">[788]</a></span></p>

<p>While these dangers were accumulating on the
heads of the friends of the Reformation in Geneva
itself, perils not less great were gathering round
the city. People arriving from the country on the
left bank of the Rhone and of the lake reported that
armed Friburgers and Savoyards were assembling in
great numbers at the castle of Gaillard, and that one of
the Wernlis commanded a part of them. It was well
known that this person, exasperated by the death of
his relative the canon, combined in his heart, along
with the love and respect he bore to his memory, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">{552}</a></span>
more energetic sentiment—that of revenge. The
knights and soldiers who gathered round him caught
the infection of his anger. But not at Gaillard only
were armed men assembling, according to the reports
of the country people: there were some higher
up, in the direction of the mountains, at Etrembières,
where there was a ferry over the Arve to the <i>mandement</i>
of Mornex. Others were assembling higher still
around the picturesque hill of Montoux, and especially
at the village of Collonges, at the foot of the
hill. At the same time, the people who came to
Geneva from the right bank of the Rhone and the
lake, from the side of the Jura, brought similar
tidings, and spoke of armed men in the Gex district,
and particularly at the Grand Saconnex, three-quarters
of a league from Geneva. The city was
beginning to be surrounded by its enemies.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_789" id="Ref_789" href="#Foot_789">[789]</a></span></p>

<p>The time seemed near when the projects conceived
by the bishop at Arbois were about to be realised.
That prelate, who reproached his friend Besançon
Hugues for not having '<i>barked</i>' loud enough to prevent
the fall of his authority, proposed not only
to bark himself against the '<i>wolves</i>,' but also to bite
them. One of those priests whom Rome had raised
to the rank of princes of nations had said: 'I am
accustomed to act vigorously.... I shall consider
what it must be.' The pontiff was preparing to fulfil
his own prophecies.</p>

<p class="side">=GENEVA AND CALVIN.=</p>

<p>The future of Geneva was indeed threatening.
On the 10th of July a gloomy veil seemed to be
closing over that noble city. A fanatical party was
preparing the shroud in which it designed to bury
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">{553}</a></span>
the independence of the citizens and the Reformation
of the Church. That city, for which many persons
had already anticipated a more glorious destiny, was
about to be reduced to a mere provincial town, occupying
an undistinguished place in the world, and
subject to the enervating influence of Rome, without
life and without liberty.</p>

<p>But other things were written in heaven. God
was preparing both Geneva and Calvin to deliver
battle together, on the result of which was to depend
the triumph of the Gospel and the liberty of modern
nations. And to prepare for these glorious events,
the steps of the great reformer were soon to be
directed, undesignedly on his part, towards that
small but energetic city, unique of its kind in Europe,
and of which the man of God was not then thinking.</p>

<p>We shall not forget that other nations have also
added their stone to the edifice of civil and religious
liberty. From Switzerland, Germany, the Low
Countries, the British Isles, France, and afterwards
America, as well as other countries, were to proceed
some of the acts destined to secure the triumph
of God's right and man's liberties.</p>

<p>And yet Calvin and Geneva did something. Calvin
possessed an inflexible resolution. God had said to
this man as he had said of old to one of his prophets:
<i>As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy
forehead; fear them not, neither be dismayed at their
looks, though they be a rebellious house</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_790" id="Ref_790" href="#Foot_790">[790]</a></span>
It was not by chance, as it is termed, that such a character was
called to the midst of a people who had shown
in terrible struggles, watered with the blood of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">{554}</a></span>
best citizens, an indomitable resistance to absolute
power. At the period of history we are describing
God was preparing Calvin and Geneva each apart;
but the union of those two natures, predestined (if I
may say so) for each other, could not fail to produce
remarkable effects in the world. The reformer was
about to concentrate in this little corner of earth a
moral force which would contribute to save the
Reformation in Europe, and to preserve in a few
more favoured spots those precious liberties to which
all nations have equal rights.</p>

<p>It was necessary in the 16th century that a great
man and a little people should serve as a centre to
the Reformation. The firmness of the one, the energy
of the other, tempered like steel in the waters of the
Gospel, were to give the tone to nations that were
greater though possibly less decided, and to impress
the seal of unity on other energies. <i>Behold how
great a matter a little fire kindleth!</i></p>

<p>While waiting for this new dawn, sorrow reigned in
Geneva. The reformers were expelled, their most
fervent disciples were in prison, or wandering through
the country; and the sword was suspended over the
heads of all the friends of God's word. The mamelukes
triumphed. The friends of the Gospel and of
liberty asked with anguish if the day of great tribulation
was come at last.... The wives of the
prisoners and of the fugitives expected to hear every
moment of some new tragedy. Children called for
their fathers, who came not to the call. Groans and
lamentations, apprehension and even cries of anger,
prevailed everywhere.</p>

<p class="side">=FAITH AND HOPE.=</p>

<p>Only a few souls, putting their trust in God, preserved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">{555}</a></span>
some little hope. Knowing that 'God is not God
unless He is on a throne, that is, unless he governs
the world, they feared nothing, however terrible it might be,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_791" id="Ref_791" href="#Foot_791">[791]</a></span>
from the hands of the powers of the earth.
In the midst of agitated hearts and dejected faces,
there were eyes which, though dimmed with tears,
were raised towards heaven with a glance of hope
and faith.</p>
